# run_efx_pnr.sh — Place & Route for SoC+CM combined project
# Run from the project root (the folder containing SoC/)
# Usage: bash SoC/run_efx_pnr.sh
#
# NOTE: Some Efinity installations (especially Chromebook Penguin) have a broken
# command-line efx_pnr that crashes with "Unsupported value for family=".  If
# that happens, use the Efinity GUI instead:
#   1. Open Efinity GUI
#   2. File → Open Project → select church_soc_cm.xml
#   3. Project → Place & Route
#   4. Project → Generate Bitstream
