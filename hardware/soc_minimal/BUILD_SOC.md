# BUILD_SOC.md — Sapphire SoC Minimal UART Gate Test

## What this builds

A minimal Efinix Sapphire SoC bitstream for the Ti60F225 devkit.
On power-on it sends `CHURCH Ti60 v1.0\r\n` over **ttyUSB2** at 115200 baud.
Pressing the push button (**GPIOT_N_06**, active-low) re-sends the same
greeting without reprogramming or power-cycling the board — useful for
repeated UART path verification during hardware bring-up.
LED0 lights when the SoC is out of reset.

This is the gate test confirming the physical UART path through the FT4232H
chip (GPIOL_01/02 → FT4232H interface 2 → ttyUSB2).

## Prerequisites

| Item | Notes |
|---|---|
| Efinity 2025.2 | Installed at `~/efinity/2025.2` |
| Efinity RISC-V IDE 2025.2 | Toolchain at `~/efinity/efinity-riscv-ide-2025.2/toolchain/bin` |
| Sapphire SoC IP | Ships with Efinity — path given in Step 1 |
| `pyserial` | `pip install pyserial` — for the test step |

---

## Steps

### Step 1 — Copy the Sapphire SoC IP files

The Sapphire SoC source (`sapphire.v` and `sapphire_define.vh`) ships with
Efinity and **must not be committed to the repo**.  Copy them into the project
directory:

```bash
cp ~/efinity/2025.2/ipm/ip/efx_tsemac/fpga/Ti60F225_devkit/ip/sapphire/sapphire.v \
   hardware/soc_minimal/

cp ~/efinity/2025.2/ipm/ip/efx_tsemac/fpga/Ti60F225_devkit/ip/sapphire/sapphire_define.vh \
   hardware/soc_minimal/
```

> **If the path above does not exist** on your installation, search for the
> file:
> ```bash
> find ~/efinity -name "sapphire.v" 2>/dev/null
> ```
> Then update `top.v` if the UART0 base address in `sapphire_define.vh` differs
> from `0xF0010000` (see the `UART_BASE` define in `firmware/main.c`).

---

### Step 2 — Verify addresses (optional but recommended)

Open `hardware/soc_minimal/sapphire_define.vh` and confirm:

- **ROM base address** — typically `` `define ONCHIP_MEM_BASE 32'h00000000 ``.
  If different, update `ORIGIN` of the `ROM` section in `firmware/link.ld`.

- **RAM base address** — typically `` `define ONCHIP_MEM_BASE_1 32'h00080000 ``.
  If different, update `ORIGIN` of the `RAM` section in `firmware/link.ld`.

- **UART0 base address** — typically `` `define APB_UART0_BASE 32'hF0010000 ``.
  If different, update `UART_BASE` in `firmware/main.c`.

- **GPIO base address** — typically `` `define APB_GPIO_BASE 32'hF0020000 ``.
  If different, update `GPIO_BASE` in `firmware/main.c`.
  The push button (GPIOT_N_06) is read from **bit 6** of the GPIO input register
  (`GPIO_BASE + 0x00`).  The pin is active-low (hardware weak pull-up set in
  `church_soc.peri.xml`); a logical 0 means pressed.

No changes needed if the defaults match.

---

### Step 3 — Build the firmware

```bash
make -C hardware/soc_minimal/firmware
```

Expected output ends with a `firmware.hex` file.
If the toolchain is installed elsewhere, override `TOOLCHAIN`:

```bash
make -C hardware/soc_minimal/firmware TOOLCHAIN=/path/to/riscv-none-embed/bin
```

Copy `firmware.hex` into the project directory so Efinity can find it during
elaboration:

```bash
cp hardware/soc_minimal/firmware/firmware.hex hardware/soc_minimal/
```

---

### Step 4 — Open the project in Efinity

1. Launch Efinity 2025.2.
2. **File → Open Project** → navigate to `hardware/soc_minimal/church_soc.xml`.
3. In **Project Settings** confirm:
   - Top module: `top`
   - Device: `Ti60F225`
4. Confirm the three source files are listed (`top.v`, `sapphire.v`,
   `sapphire_define.vh`).

---

### Step 5 — Compile (Synthesis → Place & Route → Bitstream)

Click the **Compile** button (or run all three flows sequentially).

Efinity will:
1. Read `firmware.hex` and embed it in the on-chip ROM during synthesis.
2. Place and route the Sapphire SoC on the Ti60F225 fabric.
3. Generate the programming bitstream.

No SDC file is needed — the design runs at 25 MHz directly from the crystal
and Efinity's default timing constraints are sufficient.

---

### Step 6 — Program the board

1. Connect the Ti60F225 devkit via USB.
2. In Efinity, open the **Programmer** tool.
3. Select the `.hex` bitstream generated in the `outflow/` directory.
4. Click **Program**.

---

### Step 7 — Test: receive the UART message

After programming, within 3 seconds of power-on (or reset) the board sends the
greeting.  Press the push button (**GPIOT_N_06**) at any time to re-send the
greeting without reprogramming.  A ~10 ms software debounce (250,000 cycles at
25 MHz) is applied; hold the button for at least 10 ms for a clean trigger.
The firmware re-arms after full release, so one press = one retransmit.

Test it with either of these commands:

**Quick Python one-liner:**

```bash
python3 -c "
import serial
s = serial.Serial('/dev/ttyUSB2', 115200, timeout=5)
s.setRTS(False)
s.setDTR(False)
print(s.read(100))
"
```

Expected output:

```
b'CHURCH Ti60 v1.0\r\n'
```

**Alternative — picocom:**

```bash
picocom -b 115200 /dev/ttyUSB2
```

You should see `CHURCH Ti60 v1.0` printed within 3 seconds of reset.
Press `Ctrl+A Ctrl+X` to exit picocom.

## What each file does

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `top.v` | Top-level Verilog — instantiates the Sapphire SoC, wires UART and LEDs |
| `church_soc.xml` | Efinity project file — device, sources, synthesis settings |
| `church_soc.peri.xml` | Pin assignments — clock, UART TX/RX, push button, LEDs |
| `firmware/main.c` | Bare-metal C — sends greeting on boot; re-sends on button press (debounced) |
| `firmware/crt0.S` | RISC-V startup — sets stack, zeroes BSS, calls main |
| `firmware/link.ld` | Linker script — ROM at 0x00000000, RAM at 0x00080000 |
| `firmware/Makefile` | Builds `firmware.elf` then `firmware.hex` |
| `sapphire.v` | **(copy from Efinity IP — not in repo)** Sapphire SoC RTL |
| `sapphire_define.vh` | **(copy from Efinity IP — not in repo)** Sapphire SoC defines |
| `firmware.hex` | **(generated by make — not in repo)** ROM init file for synthesis |

---

## Troubleshooting

**`sapphire.v` not found during synthesis**
→ Re-run Step 1; the file must be in `hardware/soc_minimal/`.

**`firmware.hex` not found during synthesis**
→ Re-run Steps 3 and the copy sub-step; the hex must be in `hardware/soc_minimal/`.

**ttyUSB2 not present**
→ Check `ls /dev/ttyUSB*` with the board plugged in.  The FT4232H creates
four interfaces; interface 2 (index 0) is the UART.  On some hosts it appears
as `/dev/ttyUSB0` if no other FTDI devices are connected — adjust accordingly.

**No output after programming (LED0 lit but ttyUSB2 silent)**
→ The Sapphire SoC UART `clockDivider` register resets to `0x00` on power-up,
making the UART run at clk/8 = 3.125 Mbaud — silence on any terminal.
Firmware must write `UART_CLOCKDIV = 26` (for 115200 baud at 25 MHz) before
the first `uart_puts()`.  Verify this line is present in `firmware/main.c`:
```c
UART_CLOCKDIV = UART_DIV_115200;   /* must come before uart_puts() */
```
If the line is missing, add it, rebuild the firmware, and re-synthesize
(the firmware is baked into the bitstream BRAM at synthesis time).

**No output after programming (LED0 off)**
→ Confirm LED0 lights (SoC out of reset).  If it does not light, the SoC is
still in reset; check that `io_asyncReset` is tied to `1'b0` in `top.v`.

**FIRMWARE_INIT_FILE parameter not recognised**
→ Open `sapphire.v` and search for `$readmemh` to find the exact parameter
name, then update `top.v` accordingly.  Common alternative: `BOOT_HEX`.

**Wrong UART address (garbage / no output, but LED0 lit)**
→ Check `sapphire_define.vh` for the UART0 base address and update
`UART_BASE` in `firmware/main.c`, then rebuild and re-synthesize.

**Button press does not retransmit the greeting**
→ Confirm the GPIO base address: open `sapphire_define.vh` and look for
`APB_GPIO_BASE` (or `APB_GPIO_A_BASE`).  If it differs from `0xF0020000`,
update `GPIO_BASE` in `firmware/main.c`, rebuild, and re-synthesize.
→ Confirm the bit position: GPIOT_N_06 is bit 6.  If the Sapphire SoC
maps GPIOT to a different port word, adjust `BUTTON_BIT` accordingly.
→ The button is active-low.  If the pull-up is missing, the input floats
and `BUTTON_PRESSED` may read true permanently — the firmware will send
the greeting continuously at boot.  Verify the weak pull-up assignment in
`church_soc.peri.xml`.
