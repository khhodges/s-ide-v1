# CLOOMC ISA Foundation Document

**v1.1 — 2026-05-15**
**CONFIDENTIAL**

This document records the design session held in May 2026 between the original PP250 designer and the Church Machine team. It explains *why* important decisions were made, not just what the decision might be — so that future followers of this Church Machine movemext understand the constraints to respect and theprinciples to preserve. It starts with the The Six Laws of CLOOMC a one-page summation of the foundational principles of capability-based computer architecture.

1. The Law of Capability where authority flows through unforgeable Golden Tokens
2. The Law of Namespace Privacy whre every binding lives inside a Golden Token
3. The Law of Delegation were rights are given, and cnnot be seized
4. The Law of Confinement that guarantees computation cannot exceed transparent tokens
5. The Law of Revocation to limit and withdraw any authority previously granted
6. The Law of Integrity using seals to verify granted origin without disclosure

## 1. Heritage and Distinction

### The First Immersive Capability Computer (PP250)

The PP250 (Plessey UK, 1972) was the first immersive capability computer to be sucessfully fielded commercially. It operated for two decades without a single reported security breach to the capability model. Every object in the
PP250 was accessed through a hardware-validated capability key, a descriptor; no program could reach memory it did not hold a descriptor for. The system survived in production and served in the first Gulf War. It accumulated the necessary operational evidence to turn a theoretical model into a proven if incomplete engineering discipline.

The Church Machine is the PP250's direct and architectural complete successor. The lineage is not metaphorical — it is architectural. The key PP250 designer is also after half a century of binary computer failures the Church Machine designer.

### What the Church Machine has Perfected

Three things about flawless computation inherited from the PP250:

1. **The capability model.** Every memory access is mediated by a
   hardware-validated token. There is no ambient authority; there is no
   privileged mode that bypasses the check. If you do not hold a valid
   token, you cannot touch the memory. These laws apply to Boot at the
   instant power is applied

3. **Hardware-enforced capability keys**, promoted to the digital gold of international cyberspace. The NS table is the direct descendant of the PP250's segment table. Each entry describes a region of memory — its location, its size, and its current version. The hardware recomputes the integrity check on every access and rejects anyentry that has been tampered with.

4. **The principle that capabilities ARE the IDE.** In the PP250 the
   descriptor table was the system map. In the Church Machine the Namespace
   table, viewed through the IDE, is the complete, live description of
   everything the running system can reach. There is no separate registry,
   no configuration file, no out-of-band channel. The namespace is the
   system.

### What Is New

Three things are new in the Church Machine:

1. **LUMP architecture.** A LUMP is a power-of-2-sized, self-describing
   binary package for a single abstraction — its code, its c-list, and its
   header word in one contiguous block. LUMPs are the packaging and delivery
   system. They did not exist in the PP250. The PP250 loaded segments from
   disk; the Church Machine fetches LUMPs from the IDE, from a tunnel, or
   from the Mum Library. LUMP is how abstractions travel between systems.

2. **CLOOMC ISA.** Capability-Limited / Object-Oriented / Machine-Code is
   the core technology — the instruction set that runs on the Church Machine
   processor. CLOOMC is what is compiled, what is deployed, and what the
   hardware executes. It is not a scripting layer or a bytecode. It is the
   machine code.

3. **Golden Token 32-bit encoding.** The PP250's descriptors were wide
   hardware words. The Church Machine encodes the full capability — slot
   index, revocation sequence, permission bits, bind flag, and type — into
   a single 32-bit word. Every GT is a complete, self-contained capability
   expression that can be validated, forged only with the secret, and
   revoked in O(1) by incrementing a 7-bit counter.

---

## 2. The CLOOMC Capability Model

### Golden Tokens as Symbolic Expressions

A Golden Token is not merely an access key. It is a symbolic expression of
functionality. The 32-bit GT word encodes:

- **What** can be accessed (`slot_id`, 16 bits — the namespace index)
- **How** it can be accessed (`dom` + `perm[2:0]`, 4 bits — domain selector (0=Turing {X,W,R}, 1=Church {E,S,L}) plus 3-bit permission payload; Turing/Church mutual exclusion is structurally enforced by the `dom` bit)
- **Whether** this instance is current (`gt_seq`, 7 bits — revocation counter)
- **What kind** of resource it is (`gt_type`, 2 bits — Null, Inform, Outform, Abstract)
- **Whether** it can be propagated (`b_flag`, 1 bit — bind permission)
- **Whether** it targets a far/remote resource (`f_flag`, 1 bit — Far indicator, per-token)

The permissions are not advisory. The hardware reads the permission bits
before permitting any instruction to proceed. A program that holds only an
E (Enter) GT for an abstraction cannot read the abstraction's data, cannot
write to its c-list, and cannot execute its code directly. It can only call
the abstraction's published entry point. This is capability confinement
implemented in silicon, not in software policy.

### The DNA Hierarchy

A GT hierarchy is a complete, self-describing blueprint of an application's
functional composition. Consider: a thread holds GTs to its abstractions;
each abstraction holds GTs to the abstractions it depends on; those
abstractions hold GTs to their dependencies; and so on down to the hardware
peripherals. The resulting directed graph is the application's DNA — every
function the application can perform is traceable through a chain of
validated GTs from the thread's c-list.

This has a consequence that is easy to miss: **you cannot add a capability
to a running system without going through the namespace**. There is no
back-channel. If a GT does not exist in the chain, the functionality
it represents is unreachable. Privilege escalation requires minting a new
GT — and minting requires holding Mint's E-GT, which is itself a capability
controlled by the namespace.

### Lambda Calculus Foundation

Every abstraction is a pure function in the lambda calculus sense: it takes
inputs (via its c-list and data registers), produces outputs, and has no
side effects beyond what its capabilities explicitly permit. Composition is
well-formed by construction: if abstraction A holds an E-GT to abstraction
B, then A can call B, and the hardware enforces that the call proceeds
exactly as B's interface specifies — no more, no less.

The CLOOMC instruction set is the operational realisation of this model.
CALL is function application. RETURN is function completion. LAMBDA is
lightweight in-scope application (a function applied within the same
capability domain). LOAD and SAVE are c-list read and write — the
operations that assemble function compositions.

### Mathematical Provability

The type of each token constrains what it can be applied to. An E-GT
constrains the holder to CALL only. An R-GT constrains the holder to DREAD
only. The hardware enforces these constraints at every instruction boundary.
Because the constraints are enforced in hardware and the GT chain is
inspectable (via the namespace), the behaviour of the whole system is
derivable from the parts: if you can see every GT in the chain and you know
the abstraction at each slot, you can predict every operation the system is
capable of performing.

This is not just an academic property. It is the basis for the reliability
model (Section 3): the capability envelope IS the specification, and
deviations from it are detectable faults, not silent corruptions.

### Fail-Safe by Construction

Faults cannot propagate outside the capability envelope. When an abstraction
faults — bad GT, bounds violation, permission denied, integrity check
failure — the fault is contained at the boundary. The hardware fires the
fault handler; the capability chain that led to the fault is preserved in
the fault record; no other abstraction's state is disturbed. This is not
recovery by hope. It is recovery by hardware geometry.

A fault in abstraction B cannot corrupt abstraction A's c-list because A's
c-list is protected by A's lump boundary, which B cannot cross without
holding A's S-GT — and A did not give B that GT. Confinement is structural.

### Dynamic Extension

New abstractions can be loaded, new tokens minted, and new capabilities
distributed without breaking the proven properties of what is already
running. This is possible because the namespace is the authority table: a
new entry in the namespace is a new entry — it cannot forge an entry that
already exists; it cannot inherit permissions from a neighbouring entry; it
is exactly what Mint wrote and nothing else.

---

## 3. The Reliability Model

### The Error Space After Security

Once security is guaranteed — that is, once the capability model is hardware-
enforced and the GT chain is the sole path to any resource — the error space
for a running system collapses to exactly two categories:

1. **Specification error** — the abstraction was told to do something the
   designer did not intend.
2. **Implementation error** — the abstraction was asked to do something
   correct but its code produced the wrong result.

Nothing else is possible. An attacker cannot inject a third category because
the capability envelope prevents it. A bug in one abstraction cannot corrupt
another because the hardware boundary prevents it. This is why the
reliability model can be quantitative.

### Hidden Implementation

Fixing an abstraction is always local. The capability envelope is the
contract — the GT defines what the holder can ask for; the hardware enforces
it; the lump defines what the abstraction does when asked. As long as the
new lump honours the same contract (same entry points, same permission
requirements), any holder of the E-GT will see the fix transparently on
the next CALL. **Regression is impossible by construction**: the new lump
cannot reach anything the old lump could not reach, because both are
confined by the same GT chain.

### The Capability System as Runtime IDE Extension

Every fault carries precise diagnostic information:

- The GT that was being used when the fault occurred
- The permission that was denied (or the check that failed)
- The pipeline stage where the check happened (GT type, gt_seq,
  integrity32, bounds, permission)
- The abstraction slot and label
- The instruction mnemonic

This information is not scraped from a stack trace after the fact. It is
produced by the hardware pipeline as a structural output of the fault
detection mechanism. The IDE captures it. The fault record is as precise
as the hardware can make it — which is very precise.

### MTBF Per Abstraction

Every fault event against an abstraction contributes to its MTBF
(Mean Time Between Failures) measurement. The MTBF is computed per NS
slot: total operational time divided by total fault count. The result is
a quantitative reliability measure for every abstraction in the namespace.

Improvement effort is therefore never wasted. The IDE ranks abstractions
by MTBF. The weakest link is always visible. A developer looking at the
MTBF table knows immediately which abstraction needs attention — not
because someone guessed, but because the hardware counted.

### The Closed Feedback Loop

```
IDE → compile → deploy → fault capture → MTBF ranking → targeted fix → re-deploy
```

This loop is closed by the capability model. Deployment goes through the
namespace (Navana is the sole NS writer). Faults are captured by the
hardware pipeline and reported to the IDE via the call-home mechanism.
MTBF is computed server-side from the fault log. The developer sees the
MTBF table in the IDE, fixes the weakest abstraction, compiles, and
re-deploys. The loop has no gap. Every step is mediated by a capability
that the IDE controls.

---

## 4. The Trusted Security Base (TSB)

### The TSB Principle

The Trusted Security Base is the set of components that must be correct for
the security model to hold. In the Church Machine, the TSB is defined by a
strict rule:

> **Only what is logically prior to the first CLOOMC instruction may be
> in the TSB. Everything else must be a CLOOMC abstraction.**

"Logically prior" means: things the processor needs before it can execute
its first instruction. This includes the processor hardware itself (the
mLoad pipeline, the GT validation logic, the instruction decoder), the boot
ROM that initialises the registers, and the boot image that is present in
RAM when power is applied. Nothing else.

### The Irreducible Minimum

The minimum boot image that satisfies the TSB principle contains exactly
three things:

1. **One Namespace** — the NS table that describes what physical memory
   exists and where. Without a namespace, the processor cannot validate any
   GT. The namespace is logically prior to the first instruction.

2. **One Thread** — the execution context: PC, register file, call stack.
   Without a thread, there is no execution. The thread lump is logically
   prior to the first instruction.

3. **One first Abstraction** — the code the thread starts executing. Without
   a first abstraction, there is nothing to run. The first abstraction is
   logically prior to the first instruction.

These three together form the **3-LUMP Starter Kit** (Section 7).

### Anything Extra Is a Threat

Every component added to the TSB beyond the irreducible minimum is:

- A complexity cost: more to audit, more to get wrong
- An attack surface: more code running before security is fully established
- A conceptual confusion: something that looks like a CLOOMC abstraction
  but is not protected by the capability model

The free slot 2 in the current demo boot image (the historical remnant of
Startup.Config) is an example of a TSB violation: it sits in the boot image
at a fixed address without being either logically prior to the first
instruction or a proper CLOOMC abstraction. It fails the TSB test on both
counts.

### The LUMP Architecture Must Be Supportive, Not Subtractive

The LUMP architecture (packaging, delivery, lazy load) is the mechanism that
allows everything above the irreducible minimum to be a proper CLOOMC
abstraction. Navana, Mint, Memory Manager, the Loader, the GC — these are
all abstractions delivered as LUMPs, loaded lazily on first CALL. They do
not need to be in the TSB. The LUMP architecture is what makes the TSB
small enough to actually audit.

---

## 5. Memory Architecture

The memory architecture is defined entirely by the three foundation LUMPs.
There are no other configuration parameters.

### Hardware Rules

- **Lump sizes** are powers of 2, minimum 64 words. The mLoad pipeline uses
  bit-shifts to find lump boundaries — not addition.
- **NS table** is the NS LUMP — it lives at address 0x0000, the start of
  memory. `totalNamespaceWords` is the programmer's choice, encoded in the
  NS LUMP header.
- **cc field** (8 bits) limits c-list rows to 255 per lump. It does not limit
  NS slots — the GT `slot_id` field is 16 bits, allowing up to 65,535 slots.
- **limit17** (17 bits) caps the pool at 131,071 words — enough headroom above
  the Ti60's 64 KB to make the Ti60 a clean subset, not a tight fit.

### LUMP Types

The `typ` field (bits [9:8] of the header word) identifies one of three LUMP types:

| `typ` | Type | What it defines |
|-------|------|-----------------|
| `00` | **Abstraction** | Executable CLOOMC code body + freespace + GT c-list |
| `01` | **Namespace object** *(reserved)* | Memory size and namespace size — not yet implemented |
| `10` | **Thread** | Stack size and heap size |

### The Three Foundation LUMPs

| # | LUMP | NS Slot | Role | Must be in ROM? |
|---|------|---------|------|-----------------|
| 1 | **NS LUMP** | 0 | `totalNamespaceWords` — the board's physical memory envelope; everything else follows from this one value | Yes — logically prior to everything |
| 2 | **Thread LUMP** | 1 | Any stack and heap size desired; `Thread.CR0` holds the E-GT for the Application LUMP | Yes — logically prior to first instruction |
| 3 | **Application LUMP** | IDE-configured (slot 4 = Salvation on hardware demo) | First abstraction the thread calls via `Thread.CR0`; content is board- and IDE-dependent | Yes — the entry point |

Slot 2 is the first available catalog slot. Slot 3 is the hardware boot
code domain (privileged; no user-visible NS table entry). Slot 4 onward is
the dynamic pool; the IDE writes the Application LUMP slot into
`Thread.CR0` via `setBootEntrySlot()`.

### What Follows Automatically

```
foundation_end  = NS_LUMP_SIZE + THREAD_LUMP_SIZE
                = 64 + 256 = 320 words = 0x0140  (2-LUMP boot overhead)

Dynamic pool    = foundation_end  →  totalNamespaceWords − 1

Pool ceiling    = totalNamespaceWords − 1
                = 65,535  (Ti60 F225)
                = 131,071 (XC7A100T)
```

Nothing else needs to be set. The programmer supplies the NS LUMP and
Thread LUMP. The hardware boot ROM (3 instructions, see Section 6) handles
the rest. Slot 2 is the first available catalog slot; slot 4 onward is
the dynamic pool.

---

## 6. The Boot Layout

The DMEM image uses a 4-region layout:

```
Address     Region          Words   Status
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
0x0000      NS Lump          64     Necessary — NS root (slot 0)
0x0040      Thread Lump     256     Necessary — boot thread (slot 1)
0x0140      Dynamic Pool      ∞     Necessary — allocatable heap
top−0x400   NS Table      1,024     Necessary — capability table
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
```

The 3-instruction boot ROM program lives in IMEM (separate from DMEM),
starting at byte address 0x0000. It is hardware — not a LUMP, not in the
NS table, not user-visible.

NS slot 2 is null (NS entry all-zeros; no physical lump reservation).
NS slot 3 is the boot code domain: hardware-privileged, CR14 points here
during BOOT_PROGRAM execution, no user-visible NS table entry.
Slot 4 = Salvation (the hardware demo Application LUMP; NUC_PROGRAM).
The first user-authored abstraction is placed at slot 2 onward by the IDE
or Navana.

### The 3-Instruction Hardware Boot ROM

The hardware executes exactly three instructions from IMEM on every reset
(`hardware/boot_rom.py`, `BOOT_PROGRAM`):

```
[0] LOAD   AL, CR15, CR15[0]   — refresh Namespace cap from slot 0 into CR15
[1] CHANGE AL, CR12, CR15, #1  — load Boot.Thread (slot 1); establishes CR0–CR11
[2] CALL   AL, CR0,  CR0       — enter Thread.CR0 (IDE-configured Application LUMP)
```

This is the complete boot sequence. There is no intermediate state, no
privilege escalation, and no code outside the capability model. The IDE
configures `Thread.CR0` (via `setBootEntrySlot()`) before power-on; the
hardware demo pre-loads it with an E-GT for Salvation (slot 4).

### What Was Removed and Why

**Free slot 2 failed the TSB test.**
Slot 2 (formerly Startup.Config, address range 0x0140–0x017F) was dead
space with no code, no c-list, and no meaningful lump header. Removing it
eliminates 64 words of dead space and gives slot 2 back as the first
available catalog slot.

---

## 7. The 3-LUMP Starter Kit

The clean model. The bitstream has exactly two parts:

**Part 1 — CLOOMC ISA**: the processor hardware. mLoad pipeline, Golden
Token validation, instruction execution. This never changes once programmed.
Silicon is silicon.

**Part 2 — Read-only RAM image**: exactly three LUMPs.

| # | LUMP | NS Slot | Role | Must be in ROM? |
|---|------|---------|------|-----------------|
| 1 | Namespace LUMP | 0 | Total physical memory envelope; owned under M authority | Yes — logically prior to everything |
| 2 | Thread LUMP | 1 | Boot execution context; register file, call stack; `Thread.CR0` = E-GT for the Application LUMP | Yes — logically prior to first instruction |
| 3 | Application LUMP | IDE-configured (slot 4 = Salvation on hardware demo) | First thing the thread calls via `Thread.CR0`; board- and IDE-dependent | Yes — the entry point |

**Boot sequence — three hardware ROM instructions then one CALL:**
1. `LOAD AL, CR15, CR15[0]` — refresh Namespace cap (slot 0) into CR15.
2. `CHANGE AL, CR12, CR15, #1` — load Thread LUMP (slot 1); establishes CR0–CR11 including `Thread.CR0`.
3. `CALL AL, CR0, CR0` — enter `Thread.CR0`, the IDE-configured Application LUMP.

The IDE writes the chosen slot into `Thread.CR0` via `setBootEntrySlot()`
before flashing. The hardware demo pre-loads Salvation (slot 4).

**Slot 2 onward is available for catalog abstractions.** Slot 3 is the
hardware boot code domain (privileged, no NS table entry). Slot 4 = Salvation
(hardware demo Application LUMP). The dynamic pool starts at 0x0140
immediately after Boot.Thread — no gap.

On the **XC7A100T** the Application LUMP is the **Locator** — a CLOOMC
abstraction that runs on the FPGA itself, not on the IDE server. The Locator
holds three capabilities in its C-list: an Ethernet GT (for network I/O), a
Mint GT (for installing fetched LUMPs), and a NamespaceWrite GT (for
promoting Outform NS entries to Live). The moment the board is powered, the
thread calls the Locator, which opens the Ethernet link to the IDE. Everything
else (Memory Manager, Mint, Navana, the full catalogue) arrives via lazy load
over that Ethernet connection.

The Ethernet abstraction (NS slot 51) is the transport layer the Locator
uses — a separate, lower-level CLOOMC abstraction that wraps the RMII PHY
hardware on the QMTECH Wukong board. The Locator calls Ethernet.Send /
Ethernet.Receive; the Ethernet abstraction talks to the silicon.

On the **Tang Nano 20K** the transport is UART, and the Application LUMP
is the UART Locator abstraction — structurally identical to the XC7A100T
Locator but holding a UART GT instead of an Ethernet GT.

### Why This Is Correct

The ROM image is not a boot loader. It IS the application in its initial
state. The moment power is applied:

- All three LUMPs have valid headers and valid NS entries
- The hardware can validate any GT against the NS table
- The thread can execute its first CALL

There is no intermediate undefined state. There is no moment when the
system is "booting" in a way that bypasses the capability model. The
capability model is in force from the first clock cycle.

### Everything Else Is Lazy

Above the 3-LUMP foundation, every abstraction is delivered by lazy load:
its NS entry is pre-registered in the Namespace LUMP's c-list (so GTs can
be minted against it immediately), but its lump body is fetched from the
IDE or the Mum Library on first CALL. The Locator abstraction handles the
fetch-inflate-validate-mint sequence transparently. The calling thread sees
no difference between a lazy-loaded abstraction and a resident one — only
a latency cost.

This means the ROM image can be tiny (3 LUMPs, a few hundred words), and
the full system capability is unbounded. The ROM is the security base; the
network is the library.

## 8. Board Profiles and Pool GT Values

### Comparison Table

| Field | Ti60 F225 | XC7A100T |
|-------|-----------|----------|
| `totalNamespaceWords` | 65,536 | 131,072 |
| `foundation_end` (NS + Thread only) | 0x0140 (320) | 0x0140 (320) |
| Application LUMP base (slot 2) | 0x0140 (320) | 0x0140 (320) |
| Pool base (after Application LUMP) | 0x0180 (384) | 0x0180 (384) |
| Pool ceiling | 65,535 (`0xFFFF`) | 131,071 (`0x1FFFF`) |
| `limit17` (Memory pool GT) | `0x0FFFF` | `0x1FFFF` |
| Allocatable pool words | ~65,087 (~254 KB) | ~130,623 (~511 KB) |

> **Note:** `foundation_end` is identical on both boards (NS 64 w + Thread
> 256 w = 320 words = 0x0140). Null slot 2 has been removed (Task #1205).
> Lump sizes are programmer choices, not board choices — a programmer using
> the same sizes on both boards gets the same `foundation_end`. The
> Application LUMP (slot 2) begins immediately at `foundation_end`.

### Why limit17 Matters

`limit17` is the single value in the Memory Manager's pool GT that must
change when retargeting to a new board. Everything else is either:

- Hardware-forced (same on all boards): minimum lump size, alignment rules
- Identical by programmer choice: `foundation_end`, lump sizes
- Arithmetically derived: pool base, pool ceiling

The `limit17` value in the pool GT is the upper bound of the dynamic pool:
the largest word address the Memory Manager is permitted to allocate from.
On the Ti60 it is `0x0FBFF` (64,511). On the XC7A100T it is `0x1FBFF`
(130,047). When the programmer retargets from Ti60 to XC7A100T, they update
this one value and the Memory Manager immediately sees the larger pool — no
other change is required.

This is the practical consequence of the design: because lump sizes are
powers of 2 (hardware-forced) and the pool runs to `totalNamespaceWords − 1`,
the only variable when retargeting is the programmer's `totalNamespaceWords`
choice — and `limit17` is exactly the field that encodes it.
