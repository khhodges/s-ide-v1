# Beyond Integer Division — Arithmetic on the Church Machine

The Church Machine operates on 32-bit integers. There are no floating-point registers or instructions. Every value in a data register (DR0–DR7) is a whole number, and the division instruction (`/`) performs integer division via repeated subtraction, truncating any fractional part.

This means `7 / 3 = 2`, not `2.333...`.

So how do you compute precise results on integer-only hardware? This document covers three techniques — **fixed-point arithmetic**, **remainder/modulo**, and **rational numbers** — each implemented as a Lambda Calculus abstraction in the Church Machine IDE.

---

## 1. Fixed-Point Arithmetic

### The Idea

Instead of storing `2.33`, store `233` and remember that the last two digits are after the decimal point. You pick a **scale factor** (we use 100 for two decimal places) and multiply all values by it before doing arithmetic.

This is exactly how slide rules work — the S scale reads `sin(θ) × 10` to avoid sub-unit markings. The Church Machine's `FixedPointMath` abstraction applies the same principle to general computation.

### How It Works

| Real value | Fixed-point (×100) |
|---|---|
| 3.14 | 314 |
| 0.50 | 50 |
| 1.00 | 100 |
| 7.25 | 725 |

To compute `7 / 3` with two decimal places:

1. Scale up: `7 × 100 = 700`
2. Divide: `700 / 3 = 233` (integer division)
3. Interpret: `233` means `2.33`

### The Abstraction: `FixedPointMath`

Load the **LC: Fixed-Pt** example tab in the Code view.

```
abstraction FixedPointMath {
    capabilities { Constants }

    method toFixed(n)         = n * 100         -- integer → fixed-point
    method fromFixed(f)       = f / 100         -- fixed-point → integer (truncates)
    method addFixed(a, b)     = a + b           -- addition (scale preserved)
    method subFixed(a, b)     = a - b           -- subtraction (scale preserved)
    method mulFixed(a, b)     = (a * b) / 100   -- multiply then rescale
    method divFixed(a, b)     = (a * 100) / b   -- prescale then divide
    method percent(whole, pct) = (whole * pct) / 100
    method roundFixed(f)      = (f + 50) / 100  -- round to nearest integer
}
```

### Usage Examples

**Adding prices:**
- £3.50 + £2.75 → `350 + 275 = 625` → £6.25

**Multiplying with rescale:**
- 1.5 × 2.4 → `150 × 240 = 36000`, then `36000 / 100 = 360` → 3.60

**Division with prescale:**
- 7 / 3 → `toFixed(7) = 700`, then `divFixed(700, 300) = (700 × 100) / 300 = 233` → 2.33

**Percentage:**
- 15% of 200 → `percent(200, 15) = (200 × 15) / 100 = 30`

**Rounding:**
- `roundFixed(233) = (233 + 50) / 100 = 2` (rounds 2.33 down)
- `roundFixed(267) = (267 + 50) / 100 = 3` (rounds 2.67 up)

### Limitations

- **Overflow risk**: Multiplying two scaled values produces very large intermediate results. `999 × 999 = 998001` is fine in 32 bits, but `99999 × 99999` can overflow. Keep values reasonable for your scale factor.
- **Truncation**: Integer division always rounds toward zero. `roundFixed` compensates for this in the final step.
- **Scale factor is fixed**: The abstraction uses 100 (two decimal places). For more precision, change the scale to 1000 or 10000 and adjust the methods accordingly.

### Overflow Limits (Scale Factor 100, 32-bit integers)

The Church Machine uses 32-bit integers with a maximum value of 2,147,483,647 (~2.1 billion). With a scale factor of 100, each operation has a specific safe range before overflow occurs:

| Operation | Max operand(s) | Max real value | Why |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Add / Subtract** | ~1,073,741,823 each | ~10,737,418.23 | Sum must fit in 32 bits |
| **toFixed** | 21,474,836 | 21,474,836.00 | `n × 100` must not overflow |
| **Multiply** | ~46,340 each | ~463.40 × 463.40 | `a × b` intermediate must fit before `/100` rescale |
| **Divide (numerator)** | 21,474,836 | 214,748.36 | `a × 100` prescale must fit |
| **Divide (denominator)** | any non-zero | unlimited | No scaling applied to denominator |
| **Percent** | whole × pct < 2.1B | depends on combination | Same constraint as multiply |
| **roundFixed** | 2,147,483,597 | ~21,474,835.97 | `f + 50` must fit |

**Multiplication is the tightest constraint** — values above ~463 risk overflow because the intermediate product `a × b` must fit in 32 bits *before* the rescaling division by 100.

**Worked example — why 463 is the limit:**
- `46340 × 46340 = 2,147,395,600` — fits in 32 bits, then `/ 100 = 21,473,956` (represents 463.40 × 463.40 = 214,739.56)
- `46341 × 46341 = 2,147,488,281` — exceeds 2,147,483,647 and overflows

**Reducing the scale factor extends the range:**

| Scale factor | Decimal places | Multiply limit (real value) |
|---|---|---|
| 10 | 1 | ~4,634.0 |
| 100 | 2 | ~463.40 |
| 1,000 | 3 | ~46.34 |
| 10,000 | 4 | ~4.63 |

There is a direct trade-off: more precision means smaller numbers, fewer decimal places means larger numbers. For most practical uses (prices, measurements, percentages), scale factor 100 with a ~463 multiply limit is sufficient. If you need larger numbers and can tolerate less precision, drop to scale factor 10. If you need both large numbers and exact precision, use the rational number abstraction instead.

## 2. Remainder / Modulo

### The Idea

The Church Machine's division instruction works by repeated subtraction:

```
quotient = 0
remainder = dividend
while remainder >= divisor:
    remainder = remainder - divisor
    quotient = quotient + 1
```

When the loop exits, the **remainder** is still sitting in a register. Integer division discards it — but a `mod` method can return it instead.

### How It Works

`17 / 5`:
- Start: quotient=0, remainder=17
- Step 1: remainder=12, quotient=1
- Step 2: remainder=7, quotient=2
- Step 3: remainder=2, quotient=3
- Exit (2 < 5): **quotient = 3**, **remainder = 2**

So `17 / 5 = 3` with remainder `2`, meaning `17 = 5 × 3 + 2`.

### Practical Uses

- **Clock arithmetic**: `minutes mod 60` gives minutes past the hour
- **Even/odd test**: `n mod 2` is 0 for even, 1 for odd
- **Digit extraction**: `n mod 10` gives the last digit
- **Cyclic patterns**: `step mod 4` cycles through 0, 1, 2, 3, 0, 1, ...

### Connection to Fixed-Point

You can combine division and modulo to reconstruct a decimal result:

```
7 / 3 = 2       (integer part)
7 mod 3 = 1     (remainder)
```

The remainder `1` over divisor `3` gives the fractional part `0.333...`. Or using fixed-point: `(1 × 100) / 3 = 33`, so `7 / 3 = 2.33`.

---

## 3. Rational Numbers

### The Idea

Instead of approximating with fixed-point, represent every number as an exact fraction: a pair of integers `(numerator, denominator)`. The fraction `1/3` stays as `(1, 3)` — no precision is ever lost.

All arithmetic follows the standard fraction rules you learned in school:

| Operation | Rule | Example |
|---|---|---|
| a/b + c/d | (a×d + c×b) / (b×d) | 1/3 + 1/6 = (6+3)/18 = 9/18 |
| a/b − c/d | (a×d − c×b) / (b×d) | 3/4 − 1/4 = (12−4)/16 = 8/16 |
| a/b × c/d | (a×c) / (b×d) | 2/3 × 3/5 = 6/15 |
| a/b ÷ c/d | (a×d) / (b×c) | 2/3 ÷ 4/5 = 10/12 |
| a/b = c/d? | a×d = c×b? | 9/18 = 1/2? → see below |

**Equality by cross-multiplication:**

To test whether two fractions are equal, you don't need to simplify them or find common denominators. Instead, you **cross-multiply** — multiply each numerator by the other fraction's denominator — and check if the two products are the same.

The rule: **a/b = c/d** if and only if **a × d = c × b**.

Example: is 9/18 equal to 1/2?

```
Left side:  a × d = 9 × 2  = 18
Right side: c × b = 1 × 18 = 18

18 = 18 ✓  → Yes, 9/18 and 1/2 are the same fraction.
```

This works because multiplying both sides of `a/b = c/d` by `b × d` cancels the denominators, leaving `a × d = c × b`. If the products match, the fractions are equal — no matter how different the numerators and denominators look.

Another example: is 2/3 equal to 3/4?

```
Left side:  2 × 4 = 8
Right side: 3 × 3 = 9

8 ≠ 9  → No, 2/3 and 3/4 are not equal.
```

This is exactly what the `isEqual` method computes: `if (n1 * d2) == (n2 * d1) then 1 else 0`.

### The Abstraction: `RationalArith`

Load the **LC: Rational** example tab in the Code view.

```
abstraction RationalArith {
    capabilities { }

    method numerator(n, d)            = n
    method denominator(n, d)          = d

    method addNum(n1, d1, n2, d2)     = (n1 * d2) + (n2 * d1)
    method addDen(d1, d2)             = d1 * d2

    method subNum(n1, d1, n2, d2)     = (n1 * d2) - (n2 * d1)

    method mulNum(n1, n2)             = n1 * n2
    method mulDen(d1, d2)             = d1 * d2

    method divNum(n1, d2)             = n1 * d2
    method divDen(d1, n2)             = d1 * n2

    method isEqual(n1, d1, n2, d2)    = if (n1 * d2) == (n2 * d1) then 1 else 0

    method gcd(a, b)                  = if b == 0 then a
                                        else if a == b then a
                                        else if a > b then a - b
                                        else b - a
}
```

### Usage Examples

**Add 1/3 + 1/4:**
```
numerator   = addNum(1, 3, 1, 4)  = (1×4) + (1×3) = 7
denominator = addDen(3, 4)        = 3 × 4         = 12
Result: 7/12
```

**Multiply 2/3 × 3/5:**
```
numerator   = mulNum(2, 3)  = 6
denominator = mulDen(3, 5)  = 15
Result: 6/15 (simplifies to 2/5)
```

**Simplify using GCD:**
```
gcd(6, 15):
  6 < 15 → 15 - 6 = 9
  6 < 9  → 9 - 6  = 3
  6 > 3  → 6 - 3  = 3
  3 == 3 → GCD = 3

6/15 → (6/3) / (15/3) = 2/5
```

**Test equality: is 9/18 equal to 1/2?**
```
isEqual(9, 18, 1, 2) = if (9×2) == (1×18) then 1 else 0
                      = if 18 == 18 then 1 else 0
                      = 1 (yes, they are equal)
```

### Why Separate Num/Den Methods?

The Church Machine passes and returns single integer values — there are no tuple return types at the hardware level. So each fraction operation is split into two method calls: one for the numerator, one for the denominator. The caller tracks both values.

This is how real hardware fraction libraries work: you store the numerator and denominator in separate registers and call the appropriate method for each component.

### Limitations

- **Denominator growth**: Without simplification, denominators grow with every operation. After several additions, `d1 × d2 × d3 × ...` can overflow 32 bits. Use `gcd` to simplify periodically.
- **The GCD method is iterative, not recursive**: The implementation uses subtraction (`a - b`) rather than modulo (`a mod b`), so it takes more steps for values that are far apart. This is correct but slower than the Euclidean algorithm with modulo.
- **No automatic simplification**: The abstraction returns unsimplified fractions. The caller must use `gcd` and divide both components to reduce.

## Choosing the Right Technique

| Technique | Precision | Speed | Best for |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Fixed-point** | Approximate (2-4 decimal places) | Fast (one extra multiply or divide) | Prices, measurements, percentages, sensor data |
| **Remainder** | Exact (integer remainder) | Free (already computed by division) | Clock math, even/odd, digit extraction, cycles |
| **Rational** | Exact (no loss ever) | Slower (multiple method calls per operation) | Scientific computation, exact comparisons, proofs |

All three techniques compile to the same 20 Church Machine instructions. The hardware doesn't change — only the abstraction layer above it.

---

## Composing Abstractions — The Supercall Pattern

### Why Not Instances?

If you've used object-oriented languages, you might expect to create an "instance" of `FixedPointMath` or `RationalArith` that holds a value — like `myPrice = FixedPointMath(350)`. The Church Machine doesn't work that way. An abstraction is a **code block with methods**, not a data container. When you call `addFixed(350, 275)`, the values are passed in as parameters and the result comes back, but nothing is stored between calls. The abstraction has no persistent fields or internal state.

Data lives in **registers and memory**. Abstractions provide **operations** on that data. This is closer to how a real CPU works than to an object-oriented language.

### How Values Are Tracked

The caller keeps track of what values mean. For fixed-point:

```
DR1 = 350       (represents £3.50)
DR2 = 275       (represents £2.75)

DR3 = FixedPointMath.addFixed(DR1, DR2)   → 625 (represents £6.25)
```

For rational numbers, numerator and denominator live in separate registers:

```
DR1 = 1, DR2 = 3       (represents 1/3)
DR3 = 1, DR4 = 6       (represents 1/6)

DR5 = RationalArith.addNum(DR1, DR2, DR3, DR4)   → 9
DR6 = RationalArith.addDen(DR2, DR4)              → 18
-- Result: 9/18
```

### Supercalls — Composing Abstractions via Capabilities

The real power comes from **composing** abstractions. One abstraction can hold a **capability** (a Golden Token) to another abstraction in its C-List, and then call its methods using `CALL`. This is the "supercall" pattern — cross-abstraction method invocation, secured by the capability system.

In CLOOMC++, this looks like:

```
abstraction FixedPointWallet {
    capabilities { FixedPointMath }

    method addPrices(a, b) = FixedPointMath.addFixed(a, b)
    method taxTotal(price, taxRate) = FixedPointMath.mulFixed(price, taxRate)
}
```

Here, `FixedPointWallet` doesn't re-implement arithmetic — it delegates to `FixedPointMath` through its capability. The Golden Token in the C-List grants permission to call those methods. Without the token, the call is blocked by hardware.

You can chain this further:

```
abstraction Shop {
    capabilities { FixedPointWallet, RationalArith }

    method checkout(price, taxRate) = FixedPointWallet.taxTotal(price, taxRate)
    method splitBill(total, people) = RationalArith.divNum(total, people)
}
```

### The Security Dimension

This isn't just a calling convention — it's the Church Machine's security model:

- **You can only call methods on abstractions you hold a Golden Token for.** If `Shop` doesn't have `FixedPointMath` in its C-List, it cannot call `addFixed` directly — it must go through `FixedPointWallet`, which does hold that token.
- **Capabilities are unforgeable.** You cannot fabricate a Golden Token. They are granted by the system when an abstraction is created.
- **The principle of least authority applies.** Each abstraction only has access to the specific capabilities it needs. `FixedPointWallet` can do arithmetic but cannot access the shop's inventory. `Shop` can use the wallet but cannot forge new tokens.

### Instances vs. Capabilities — A Different Mental Model

| OOP concept | Church Machine equivalent |
|---|---|
| Class | Abstraction (code + method table) |
| Instance | Caller's registers + memory (data lives outside the abstraction) |
| Method call | `CALL` through a Golden Token capability |
| Inheritance | Supercall — one abstraction calls another via capability |
| Private fields | Memory within an abstraction's lump (only accessible by its own methods) |
| Constructor | The caller sets up registers and memory before the first call |

The key insight: **the "instance" is really the caller's context** — its registers, its memory region, its C-List of capabilities. The abstraction provides the operations; the caller provides the data. This is Alonzo Church's original idea applied to hardware — everything is a function, and capabilities control who can call what.

## Threads as Dynamic Instances — The PP250 Telephone Call

### The Missing Piece

The earlier sections explained that abstractions are stateless code blocks and that the caller's registers hold the data. But what happens when you need *many independent callers*, each with their own state, running at the same time?

Consider a PP250 telephone exchange handling calls to Australia. Each call needs its own state — caller ID, destination number, duration counter, billing rate, connection status. You can't share one set of registers between 50 simultaneous calls. Each call needs its own context.

The answer is **threads**. On the Church Machine, a thread *is* a dynamic instance.

### One Thread Per Call

When a call to Australia is initiated, the system spawns a new thread. That thread gets:

- **Its own register file** — DR0–DR7 hold call-specific data (caller ID in DR1, destination in DR2, duration counter in DR3, billing rate in DR4)
- **Its own program counter** — the thread executes the telephony abstraction's code independently
- **Its own capability context** — the thread holds Golden Tokens for exactly the abstractions it needs

```
Thread #47 — Call to Australia
  DR1 = 61299887766       (destination: +61 2 9988 7766)
  DR2 = 442071234567      (caller: +44 20 7123 4567)
  DR3 = 0                 (duration counter, incrementing)
  DR4 = 250               (billing rate: 2.50 per minute, fixed-point)
  
  Capabilities:
    CR1 → Telephony        (connect, disconnect, signal)
    CR2 → Billing          (startCharge, endCharge, getRate)
    CR3 → Routing          (findRoute, allocateCircuit)
```

Fifty simultaneous calls to Australia means fifty threads, each with their own registers, their own capabilities, and their own execution state. They run concurrently, sharing the telephony abstraction's *code* but never sharing *data*. When a call ends, its thread terminates.

### Static Abstractions, Dynamic Threads

This completes the picture:

| Concept | What it provides | Lifetime |
|---|---|---|
| **Abstraction** | Code — methods, logic, instruction sequences | Permanent (loaded once, shared by all callers) |
| **Thread** | State — registers, PC, capability context | Dynamic (created per call, destroyed on completion) |
| **Capability** | Permission — Golden Token granting access | Scoped to the thread that holds it |

The abstraction is the *class*. The thread is the *instance*. The capability is the *permission to use it*. This is not a metaphor — it is the actual hardware mechanism.

---

## Why This Demands Deterministic Garbage Collection

### The Problem: What Happens When a Call Ends?

When thread #47's call to Australia disconnects, the thread terminates. But it leaves behind:

- **Namespace entries** — the telephony, billing, and routing abstractions were referenced by this thread's capabilities
- **Golden Tokens** — the thread held tokens in CR1, CR2, CR3 that pointed to those entries
- **Memory** — the thread's register state and any memory lump it was using

If these resources are not reclaimed, they accumulate. A busy exchange handling thousands of calls per hour would exhaust the namespace in minutes. Every ended call that isn't cleaned up is a resource leak — and eventually, the system cannot spawn new threads for new calls.

This is not a theoretical problem. It is the *central* problem of any system that creates and destroys dynamic instances.

### Non-Deterministic GC Is Not Acceptable

Languages like Java and Go use non-deterministic garbage collection — the GC runs "when it feels like it", with unpredictable pause times and no guarantee of when resources will be freed. For a telephone exchange, this is catastrophic:

- **A GC pause during a call drops audio** — the thread stops executing, the call goes silent
- **Unpredictable reclamation means unpredictable capacity** — you cannot know how many calls the system can handle at any given moment
- **GC storms under load** — when the system is busiest (peak call volume), GC pressure is highest, causing the worst pauses at the worst time
- **Stale tokens linger** — if GC hasn't collected a terminated thread's resources, its Golden Tokens might still appear valid, creating a window for use-after-free

### The PP250 Solution: Deterministic Four-Phase GC

The Church Machine's garbage collection is deterministic — it runs in bounded time with predictable behaviour. The four phases are:

**Phase 1 — Mark:** Flag all non-empty namespace entries as potentially reclaimable (set G=1).

**Phase 2 — Scan:** Walk the full reachability tree from all live roots — active threads' capability registers, call stack frames, thread table entries. Every reachable entry has G reset to 0.

**Phase 3 — Clear:** Any entry still marked G=1 after scanning is unreachable. No active thread references it. Reclaim it.

**Phase 4 — Flip:** Toggle GC polarity for the next cycle.

The critical insight is **how liveness is signalled**: the mLoad validation pipeline — the single trusted path for all namespace access — resets the G-bit on every accessed entry as a side effect of normal execution. Active calls constantly touch their namespace entries through LOAD, SAVE, CALL, and RETURN instructions. This means:

- **Active calls automatically signal liveness** — no explicit "I'm still alive" messages needed
- **Ended calls stop touching entries** — their G-bits stay set after Mark, making them candidates for reclamation
- **The GC never interrupts a live call** — it only reclaims entries that no active thread references

### Version Bumping: Killing Stale Tokens Instantly

When an entry is swept (reclaimed), its 7-bit version number is incremented. Any outstanding Golden Token that references this entry still contains the old version number.

```
Thread #47 terminates. Its CR1 held a token for namespace entry #200 (version 5).
GC sweeps entry #200: version bumped to 6.
Entry #200 is reallocated for a new call (thread #93).

If any code still holds the old token (entry #200, version 5):
  → mLoad checks: token version (5) ≠ entry version (6)
  → FAULT — access denied
  → Use-after-free is impossible
```

The old token is now permanently invalid. It does not need to be found and erased — it invalidates itself the moment the version changes. This is O(1) revocation — no matter how many copies of a token exist, they all become invalid simultaneously when the entry's version is bumped.

### Determinism Means Guarantees

| Property | What it guarantees |
|---|---|
| **Bounded pause time** | GC runs in predictable, bounded time — no unexpected pauses |
| **Predictable capacity** | You can calculate the maximum number of concurrent calls |
| **No GC storms** | Reclamation rate is proportional to completion rate, not allocation rate |
| **Provable liveness** | If a thread is active, its entries are reachable — GC will not collect them |
| **Provable reclamation** | If a thread has terminated, its entries will be collected in the next cycle |

---

## Flawless, Fail-Safe Security

Deterministic garbage collection is not a performance optimisation. It is a **security requirement**. Without it, the capability system has gaps. With it, the system is provably secure against an entire class of attacks.

### 1. No Dangling Capabilities

When thread #47 terminates, its Golden Tokens must become unusable. Version bumping ensures this at the hardware level — any attempt to use a stale token triggers a fault. There is no time window where a terminated thread's capabilities could be exploited.

In systems without deterministic GC, there is a race: the token exists, the resource is freed but not yet collected, and a new allocation reuses the slot. The old token now points to the new resource — a classic use-after-free vulnerability. The Church Machine's version bumping eliminates this entirely.

### 2. No Resource Exhaustion Attacks

An attacker who can spawn threads (or cause calls to be initiated) might try to exhaust the namespace by creating many threads and abandoning them. With non-deterministic GC, this attack succeeds — the GC may not reclaim resources fast enough.

With deterministic GC, reclamation is guaranteed within one cycle. The namespace has a provable upper bound on occupancy: the number of currently active threads, plus one cycle's worth of recently terminated threads. The attacker cannot exceed this bound.

### 3. No Information Leakage Between Calls

When a namespace entry is swept and reallocated for a new call, the entry is cleared. Thread #93 (the new call) cannot read any data from thread #47 (the old call). The registers are fresh, the memory lump is zeroed, and the capabilities are newly minted.

This is critical for a telephone exchange: call metadata, billing records, and routing information from one call must never leak to another. Deterministic sweep with entry clearing guarantees a clean slate on every allocation.

### 4. Least Authority Per Thread

Each thread holds only the capabilities it needs for its specific task. Thread #47 has tokens for telephony, billing, and routing — but not for the exchange's configuration, other threads' billing records, or the system's boot sequence. When thread #47 terminates, those capabilities cease to exist.

There is no ambient authority that persists between calls. No global variables, no shared mutable state, no "root" capability that grants access to everything. Each thread operates in its own security sandbox, defined entirely by its C-List of Golden Tokens.

### 5. The mLoad Invariant — No Window of Vulnerability

Every capability access — every LOAD, SAVE, CALL, RETURN, CHANGE, SWITCH — validates the Golden Token against the namespace in real time through the mLoad pipeline. This validation checks:

- Is the token's version current? (Temporal safety)
- Does the token have the required permissions? (Authority check)
- Is the target entry still allocated? (Liveness check)
- Has the entry been sealed or revoked? (Integrity check)

If any check fails, the instruction faults. There is no cached validation, no "trust the token because it was valid last time". Every access is verified against the current state of the namespace.

This means there is **no window of vulnerability** between a token being issued and being used. Even if GC reclaims an entry between two successive instructions, the second instruction's mLoad will detect the version mismatch and fault.

### The Lambda Calculus Foundation

This is not coincidental. The Church Machine's security model is a direct implementation of Alonzo Church's lambda calculus at the hardware level:

- **Functions have no side effects** — abstractions are pure code, threads carry state
- **Values exist only while they are referenced** — Golden Tokens are valid only while the namespace entry is live
- **Unreferenced values can be safely collected** — deterministic GC reclaims entries that no thread can reach
- **Substitution is the only way to bind values** — capabilities are granted through the C-List, never forged or guessed
- **Reduction eliminates intermediate terms** — thread termination and GC sweep are the hardware equivalent of beta-reduction's cleanup

The PP250 telephone exchange is Church's lambda calculus made physical: every call is a lambda expression in flight, every thread is a reduction in progress, and garbage collection is the mechanism that ensures completed reductions release their resources. The security guarantees are not bolted on — they emerge naturally from the mathematical foundation.
