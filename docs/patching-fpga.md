# Getting Started with Church Machine Hardware

Every computer you use today runs on an architecture designed in the 1940s.
Programs share a flat memory space. Security is bolted on after the fact.
A single buffer overflow can hand control of the entire machine to an
attacker. We have spent seventy years patching this mistake. The Church
Machine is a different answer: **security built into every memory access,
enforced by the hardware itself.**

The design is governed by the five Laws of the Church-Turing Machine
Model:

1. **Oil and Water** — capabilities and data never mix. Code lives in
   one domain, security tokens live in another. You cannot cast a
   pointer into a capability or forge a token from raw bits. The
   hardware enforces this separation on every cycle.

2. **Double Checking** — every READ and every WRITE must be validated
   by a referenced capability context register. CR14 checks instruction
   fetch. CR12 checks thread lump access. CR5 checks code entry. No
   single point of trust — the machine cross-checks at every boundary.

3. **Distribution not Centralisation** — there is no kernel, no central
   authority, no single process that controls all resources. Each
   abstraction holds exactly the capabilities it needs. Authority is
   distributed to the edge, not hoarded at the centre.

4. **Democratic not Dictatorial** — no root user, no superuser, no
   privilege escalation. Every abstraction operates under the same
   rules. The boot firmware itself runs with limited capabilities. No
   entity can override the security model — not even the manufacturer.

5. **Calibrated and Transparent** — every capability carries explicit,
   visible permission bits (R, W, X, L, S, E) and bounds. You can
   inspect exactly what any abstraction is allowed to do. There are no
   hidden permissions, no implicit grants, no ambient authority. What
   you see is what it gets.

This is not theoretical. The Church Machine runs on real silicon today,
on two FPGA boards you can buy for the price of a textbook.

## Why This Matters

Modern software is fragile. A single vulnerability in one library can
compromise millions of machines. We accept this because the underlying
hardware offers no alternative — the CPU will execute whatever instructions
it finds in memory, regardless of who put them there.

The Church Machine eliminates this class of failure entirely. Every
abstraction (the Church Machine term for a program) runs inside a
capability-secured lump of memory. It can only access what it has been
explicitly granted permission to touch. There is no way to forge a
capability. There is no ambient authority. There is no "sudo."

This changes what software can be:

- **Immortal Software** — abstractions that run correctly for decades
  because their security properties are enforced by physics, not policy.
  No patch Tuesday. No CVEs. Code that works today works forever.

- **Zero-Trust by Default** — the 7 Zeroes: no OS, no VM, no hypervisor,
  no privilege rings, no page tables, no TLB, no syscalls. Security is
  not a layer — it is the machine.

- **Network-Transparent Capabilities** — an IoT node can securely receive
  new capabilities over the wire without firmware reflash. A sensor in a
  field and a server in a data center speak the same capability protocol.

- **Composable, Shareable Abstractions** — because every abstraction is
  self-contained and capability-secured, they can be safely shared between
  users, machines, and organisations. The Mum Tunnel Library is the
  beginning of this: a community repository where you publish abstractions
  and others can use them, knowing they cannot exceed their granted
  permissions.

**The progress of civilisation depends on raising the floor of what we
can trust.** The Church Machine raises that floor from "trust nothing"
to "trust the hardware." Every abstraction you write and share makes the
ecosystem stronger. Every capability fault that fires proves the system
works. Every child who learns to program on this machine learns security
as a first principle, not an afterthought.

## Choosing Your Board

The Church Machine runs on two FPGA boards. Both execute the same
instruction set and enforce the same capability security. The difference
is capacity.

### Efinix Ti60 F225 — Full Profile

The Ti60 is the reference platform. It has room for the complete Church
Machine, including features that push the boundaries of what a
capability-secured processor can do.

| | |
|---|---|
| **FPGA** | Efinix Titanium, 60K LUTs (~14% used) |
| **Clock** | 50 MHz (PLL from 25 MHz crystal) |
| **Memory** | 256 KB SRAM |
| **Price** | ~$300–400 (dev kit); chip alone ~$50 |
| **Best for** | Research, full OS experiments, lambda calculus, garbage collection |

**Full profile features:**
- CHANGE / SWITCH — hardware thread context switching
- LAMBDA — closure creation with NIA cache optimisation
- Fused operations — ELOADCALL, XLOADLAMBDA (load + invoke in one cycle)
- Hardware garbage collection (mark/sweep)
- Capability sealing and validation (SEAL_CHECK)
- Full ChurchOutform deployment protocol (ZIP-compatible)

**Who should choose this:** Researchers, advanced students, and anyone
who wants to explore the complete capability architecture — including
lambda calculus, garbage collection, and multi-threaded secure contexts.

### Tang Nano 20K — IoT Profile

The Tang Nano 20K is the educational and IoT platform. It runs a pruned
version of the architecture that fits a smaller, cheaper FPGA while
keeping every security guarantee intact.

| | |
|---|---|
| **FPGA** | Gowin GW2AR-18C, 20K LUTs (~22% used) |
| **Clock** | 27 MHz (direct crystal) |
| **Memory** | 64 KB BSRAM |
| **Price** | ~$20 (Sipeed) |
| **Best for** | Classrooms, IoT nodes, learning, first Church Machine |
| **UART** | On-board FT2232 — just plug in USB-C, no adapter needed |

**IoT profile:** same security, smaller footprint. Removes GC, Lambda,
Change, Switch, ELoadCall, XLoadLambda. Replaces ChurchOutform with a
lean tunnel-hunting protocol (8-byte header, raw STORE, CRC-32). Any
opcode removed from the profile triggers FAULT_OPCODE — the machine
never silently ignores a missing feature.

**Who should choose this:** Students, educators, IoT builders, and
anyone who wants the fastest path from unboxing to running secure code
on real silicon. If you are new to the Church Machine, start here.

### Side-by-Side Comparison

| Feature | Ti60 F225 (Full) | Tang Nano 20K (IoT) |
|---------|-----------------|---------------------|
| LUTs used | ~8,537 / 60K (14%) | ~4,653 / 20K (22%) |
| Clock | 50 MHz | 27 MHz |
| BRAM | 256 KB | 64 KB |
| Price | ~$300–400 (dev kit) | ~$20 |
| UART adapter | External (H14/M14 pins) | Built-in USB-C (FT2232) |
| LEDs | 4 x active-HIGH | 4 x active-LOW |
| LAMBDA instruction | Yes | FAULT_OPCODE |
| Garbage collection | Hardware mark/sweep | FAULT_OPCODE |
| Context switching | CHANGE / SWITCH | FAULT_OPCODE |
| Fused ops | ELOADCALL, XLOADLAMBDA | FAULT_OPCODE |
| Deployment protocol | Full ChurchOutform (ZIP) | ChurchOutformIoT (lean) |
| Toolchain | Efinity IDE (proprietary) | OSS CAD Suite (open source) |
| Capability security | Full Second Law | Full Second Law |
| Instruction set core | 20 instructions | 14 instructions (6 guarded) |
| Build from source | Proprietary tools required | Fully open-source |

Both boards enforce the Second Law identically. An abstraction that runs
on the Tang Nano will run on the Ti60 (the reverse is true only if the
abstraction avoids full-profile instructions).

## Getting Started: Tang Nano 20K

The Tang Nano 20K is the recommended first board. These steps take you
from unboxing to running your own code on real silicon.

### What you need

- A **Tang Nano 20K** board (~$20 from Sipeed)
- A **USB-C cable** (data, not charge-only)
- A computer running **Linux** or **ChromeOS** (with Linux container)

### Step 1 — Install the tools

You need **openFPGALoader** to flash the bitstream and **Python 3 +
pyserial** to send code patches over UART.

```bash
# OSS CAD Suite — includes openFPGALoader and all FPGA tools
# Download from: https://github.com/YosysHQ/oss-cad-suite-build/releases
# Extract, then activate:
source ~/oss-cad-suite/environment

# pyserial — for the CLI patch tool
pip3 install pyserial
```

### Step 2 — Download the latest bitstream

From the Church Machine IDE (Replit project), download:

```
build/church_tang_nano_20k_iot.fs     (bitstream)
tools/patch_fpga.py                   (CLI patcher)
```

If no pre-built `.fs` file exists yet, you will need to build it from
source — see **Building from Source** below, then come back here.

Put both files in a working directory:

```
~/church-fpga/
├── church_tang_nano_20k_iot.fs
└── patch_fpga.py
```

### Step 3 — Plug in and check

Connect the board via USB-C:

```bash
ls /dev/ttyUSB*
```

The FT2232 chip creates two ports:

| Port | Channel | Purpose |
|------|---------|---------|
| `/dev/ttyUSB0` | A (JTAG) | openFPGALoader uses this to flash |
| `/dev/ttyUSB1` | B (UART) | patch_fpga.py sends code here at 115200 baud |

If you get permission errors:

```bash
sudo usermod -aG dialout $USER   # permanent fix (log out and back in)
sudo chmod 666 /dev/ttyUSB*      # quick fix
```

### Step 4 — Flash the bitstream

```bash
cd ~/church-fpga
openFPGALoader -b tangnano20k church_tang_nano_20k_iot.fs
```

Wait for `Done` / `DONE`. The entire flash takes about 10 seconds.

### Step 5 — Check the LEDs

| LED | Pin | Meaning | What you should see |
|-----|-----|---------|---------------------|
| led0 | 15 | Boot/Run | Solid ON — boot complete |
| led1 | 16 | Halt | Blinking — core halted, waiting for code |
| led2 | 19 | Fault | OFF — no capability fault |
| led3 | 20 | Heartbeat | Blinking ~1 Hz — clock alive |

**One solid + two blinking = success.** The Church Machine booted and is
waiting for you to send it code.

---

## Writing and Patching Code

This is your everyday workflow: write code in the IDE, compile it in the
simulator, export a patch file, and flash it with one terminal command.

```
IDE ── write ──► Patch (compile) ──► Export Patch ──► patch_fpga.py ──► FPGA
```

### Step 6 — Write your code

1. Open the Church Machine IDE in your browser
2. Click **CRs** in the toolbar
3. Click on a CR — for example, **CR14** (instruction fetch)
4. Click **Edit** to open the code editor
5. Write or modify your Church Machine assembly

### Step 7 — Compile and test in the simulator

Click **Patch**. This assembles your code into binary machine words and
writes them into the simulator memory. This is the compilation step —
it produces the binary that will be sent to the FPGA.

Step through instructions, inspect registers, and check for capability
faults before committing to real hardware. If the assembler reports
errors, fix them and click Patch again.

### Step 8 — Export the patch file

Click **Export Patch**. This packages the compiled binary into a `.patch`
file containing complete UART frames with CRC checksums and a RUN
sentinel, then downloads it.

The log shows a preview for cross-checking:

```
Block 0: Code lump  addr=0x0141  words=7
NS table update included: no

--- Patch Preview ---
  Block 0: addr=0x0141  words=7  CRC=0xD6F7  frame=36 bytes
  RUN sentinel: [0xBE 0xAA] included in file
  File size: 40 bytes

Downloaded: CR14_patch.patch
```

### Step 9 — Flash the patch to the FPGA

```bash
python3 patch_fpga.py /dev/ttyUSB1 CR14_patch.patch
```

```
Church Machine FPGA Patcher
  File   : CR14_patch.patch
  Blocks : 1
  RUN    : yes

  Block 0: addr=0x0141  words=7  CRC=0xD6F7  frame=36 bytes

  Serial : /dev/ttyUSB1 @ 115200 baud

  Block 0: TX 36 bytes  addr=0x0141  words=7  CRC=0xD6F7
           RX echo OK: addr=0x0141  count=7

  Sending RUN sentinel (0xBE 0xAA)...
  RUN sent — core executing from PC=0.

SUCCESS — all blocks patched and verified.
```

Cross-check: the CRC and address values must match between the IDE
preview and the script output.

### Step 10 — Check the LEDs

- **led0** stays solid (boot complete)
- **led1** stops blinking (core now running your code)
- **led2** OFF = no fault, ON = capability fault triggered

To change your code, repeat Steps 6–10: edit, compile, export, flash.
Each cycle takes under a minute.

---

## Getting Started: Efinix Ti60 F225

The Ti60 follows the same write-compile-export-flash workflow, with a
few differences in setup.

### Hardware differences

- The Ti60 dev board does not have an on-board UART-to-USB converter.
  You need an external UART adapter connected to pins H14 (TX) and
  M14 (RX) at 115200 baud.
- LEDs are active-HIGH (opposite polarity to the Tang Nano).
- The toolchain requires the proprietary **Efinity IDE** from Efinix
  for synthesis, place-and-route, and bitstream generation.

### Build and flash

The Ti60 build has two stages: Amaranth-to-Verilog (runs in Replit),
then synthesis through bitstream (runs in Efinity IDE on your machine).

```bash
# Stage 1: Generate Verilog + resource report (in Replit)
./build_ti60.sh build
# Produces: build/church_ti60_f225.v, build/church_ti60_f225.il,
#           build/ti60_resource_report.txt
```

Then on your local machine:

1. Open the Efinity IDE and import `hardware/ti60_f225_project.xml`
2. Add the generated `church_ti60_f225.v` as the top-level source
3. Run the Efinity synthesis, placement, and routing flow
4. Generate the bitstream (`.hex` or `.bit` file)
5. Flash using the Efinity Programmer GUI

Note: unlike the Tang Nano, the Ti60 build cannot use open-source tools
for synthesis and PnR. The `build_ti60.sh` script only prepares the
Verilog — it does not produce a flashable bitstream.

### LED meanings (same signals, opposite polarity)

| LED | Meaning | Ti60 (active-HIGH) | Tang Nano (active-LOW) |
|-----|---------|--------------------|-----------------------|
| Boot/Run | Boot complete | ON | ON |
| Halt | Core halted | ON = halted | ON = halted |
| Fault | Capability fault | ON = fault | ON = fault |
| Heartbeat | Clock alive | Blinking | Blinking |

After flashing, the patching workflow is identical: write code in the
IDE, compile with Patch, export with Export Patch, flash with
`patch_fpga.py` pointing at your UART adapter's serial port.

---

## Share Your Abstractions

The Church Machine is only as powerful as its library of abstractions.
Every abstraction you write and share makes the ecosystem stronger for
everyone.

### The Mum Tunnel Library

The Mum Tunnel is a community repository backed by GitHub where you can
publish and browse Church Machine abstractions. Each abstraction includes:

- Compiled code (machine words)
- A capability list (the exact permissions it requires)
- Metadata: author, language, description, tags
- Source code for re-compilation and learning

To publish: compile your abstraction in the IDE, click **Publish to
Library**, and it becomes available to every Church Machine user
worldwide.

To browse: click **Library** in the IDE toolbar. Search by language
(English, JavaScript, Haskell, Symbolic Math, Lambda Calculus), author,
or tags. Import any abstraction directly into your namespace with one
click.

### The Abstraction Challenge

The Church Machine community recognises excellence in three categories:

**Best New Abstraction** — the most useful, elegant, or creative
abstraction published to the Mum Tunnel Library each month. Criteria:
- Solves a real problem (not just a demo)
- Clean capability design (minimum necessary permissions)
- Well-documented with source code included
- Works on both IoT and Full profiles (preferred) or clearly
  states its profile requirement

**Highest Reliability** — the abstraction with the highest demonstrated
Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF). The simulator tracks cycle counts and
fault events. Abstractions that run millions of cycles without triggering
a capability fault earn the highest reliability rating. This is what
Immortal Software looks like in practice.

**Best Educational Abstraction** — the abstraction that best teaches a
concept. The Church Machine exists to make security accessible. An
abstraction that helps a twelve-year-old understand capabilities is
worth more than one that optimises a hash function.

### What the world needs

These abstractions do not exist yet. Someone has to write them:

- **Secure sensor abstractions** — temperature, humidity, pressure
  sensors wrapped in capability-secured interfaces for IoT deployments
- **Network tunnels** — Mum Tunnel implementations for different
  transport layers (BLE, LoRa, TCP)
- **Mathematical libraries** — Church numeral arithmetic, matrix
  operations, signal processing — all capability-secured
- **Protocol handlers** — MQTT, CoAP, HTTP parsers that run inside
  capability lumps with minimum permissions
- **Educational sequences** — step-by-step tutorials that teach
  specific security concepts through live code
- **Device drivers** — LED patterns, button debouncing, display
  controllers, all with proper capability isolation

Every abstraction you publish is a brick in the foundation of a
computing architecture that does not need patching, does not need
antivirus software, and does not give root access to buffer overflows.

**Get on board.** Pick a board. Flash a bitstream. Write an abstraction.
Share it with the world.

---

## Building the Bitstream from Source

If you need to modify the hardware design itself — add a peripheral,
change the memory map, adjust the boot ROM — you will need to build
the bitstream from Amaranth HDL source.

### Tang Nano 20K (open-source toolchain)

Everything from Step 1 above, plus ~20 GB of RAM for place and route.

```bash
# 1. Generate Verilog (in Replit)
python3 -m hardware.gen_verilog --iot build

# 2. Synthesize (in Replit)
yosys -p "read_verilog build/church_tang_nano_20k_iot.v; \
          synth_gowin -top top \
          -json build/church_tang_nano_20k_iot.json"

# 3. Download .json and .cst to your local machine

# 4. Place and route (local, needs ~20 GB RAM, 3–5 minutes)
nextpnr-himbaechel \
    --device GW2AR-LV18QN88C8/I7 \
    --json build/church_tang_nano_20k_iot.json \
    --write build/church_tang_nano_20k_iot_pnr.json \
    -o family=GW2A-18C \
    -o cst=hardware/tang_nano_20k.cst \
    --freq 27

# 5. Pack the bitstream
gowin_pack -d GW2A-18C \
    -o church_tang_nano_20k_iot.fs \
    build/church_tang_nano_20k_iot_pnr.json

# 6. Flash
openFPGALoader -b tangnano20k church_tang_nano_20k_iot.fs
```

Or use the Makefile (PnR and pack only — Verilog gen and synthesis must
be done first):

```bash
cp build/church_tang_nano_20k_iot.json hardware/
cd hardware
make tang-iot      # place-and-route + pack
make prog-iot      # flash
```

### Efinix Ti60 F225 (proprietary toolchain)

The Ti60 build requires the Efinity IDE from Efinix. The open-source
Amaranth-to-Verilog step runs in Replit, but synthesis, PnR, and
bitstream generation use Efinity.

```bash
# Generate Verilog + resource report (in Replit)
./build_ti60.sh build

# Then open the project in Efinity IDE and run the full flow
```

---

## Browser Bridge (Alternative Patching Method)

If you prefer to patch directly from the IDE without downloading files,
you can run a bridge script that relays UART between the browser and the
FPGA over HTTPS.

The Export + CLI method above is simpler and more reliable. The bridge
requires self-signed certificates and has known issues on some ChromeOS
configurations.

```
IDE (browser) ──HTTPS──► Bridge (terminal) ──USB/UART──► FPGA
```

### Setup

```bash
# Download server/local_bridge.py from the Replit project
python3 local_bridge.py /dev/ttyUSB1 115200
```

Then in Chrome:

1. Accept the self-signed certificate at `https://penguin.linux.test:8766/status`
   (on native Linux: `https://localhost:8766/status`)
2. Hard refresh the IDE (Ctrl+Shift+R)
3. Click **Bridge** in the toolbar, accept the default URL
4. Use **Patch FPGA** instead of Export Patch — it sends code directly

---

## Troubleshooting

### openFPGALoader: "No device detected"

- Is the USB cable a data cable (not charge-only)?
- Try a different USB port
- On ChromeOS: Settings > Developers > Linux > USB devices — share the
  Tang Nano

### No serial ports in /dev/ttyUSB*

```bash
sudo modprobe ftdi_sio
```

On ChromeOS, share the USB device in Linux settings.

### "Permission denied" on serial port

```bash
sudo usermod -aG dialout $USER   # permanent (log out/in)
sudo chmod 666 /dev/ttyUSB1      # quick fix
```

### "No echo received (0 bytes)"

- Is the FPGA powered with the correct bitstream?
- Are you using the right port? UART = Channel B (usually `ttyUSB1`)
- Try power-cycling the board (unplug and replug USB)

### "Editor is empty"

- Select a CR, then click Edit to load the code
- Export Patch auto-loads existing code if the editor is empty

### LEDs don't change after patching

- Check for "Echo OK" — if missing, the code didn't reach the FPGA
- Check for "RUN sent" — without this, the core stays halted
- If led2 lights up, your code triggered a capability fault
