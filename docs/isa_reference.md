# Church Machine ISA Reference

**Version 1.0 — May 2026**
**Authoritative sources: `simulator/simulator.js`, `simulator/assembler.js`, `hardware/*.py`**

This document is the single definitive specification for all 20 Church Machine
instructions. Where existing documents conflict with what is stated here, this
document takes precedence. Simulator/hardware deviations are called out
explicitly; see `docs/HARDWARE-DEVIATIONS.md` for the full deviation register.

## 1. Instruction Word Format

Every instruction is a 32-bit word with a fixed layout:

```
 31      28 27    24 23    20 19    16 15             1 0
┌──────────┬─────────┬────────┬────────┬────────────────┬───┐
│  opcode  │  cond   │  fld_a │  fld_b │     imm15      │ 0 │
│  (4 b)   │  (4 b)  │  (4 b) │  (4 b) │    (15 b)      │(1)│
└──────────┴─────────┴────────┴────────┴────────────────┴───┘
```

- **Bit 0** is always 0 (word-aligned; a 1 here is a FAULT).
- **opcode** (bits 31:28): selects one of the 20 instructions (0–19). Values 20–15 are reserved and fault.
- **cond** (bits 27:24): condition under which the instruction executes (see §2).
- **fld_a** (bits 23:20): first register operand — CR or DR index depending on instruction.
- **fld_b** (bits 19:16): second register operand — CR or DR index depending on instruction.
- **imm15** (bits 15:1): 15-bit immediate; interpretation varies per instruction.

The **all-zero word** `0x00000000` (opcode=LOAD, cond=EQ, all fields zero) is
accepted by the assembler as `HALT` or `NOP`. The simulator treats an all-zero
instruction word encountered during normal execution as a warm reboot (not a halt
and not a fault). See §4 (HALT/NOP note) for implications.

---

## 2. Condition Codes

The `cond` field gates execution on the current flag state. If the condition is
false, the instruction is skipped (PC advances, no side effects, no faults).

| Code | Mnemonic | Meaning                    | Flags tested        |
|------|----------|----------------------------|---------------------|
|  0   | EQ       | Equal / Zero               | Z = 1               |
|  1   | NE       | Not equal / Non-zero       | Z = 0               |
|  2   | LT       | Less than (signed)         | N ≠ V               |
|  3   | LE       | Less than or equal (signed)| Z = 1 or N ≠ V      |
|  4   | GT       | Greater than (signed)      | Z = 0 and N = V     |
|  5   | GE       | Greater than or equal      | N = V               |
|  6   | CS / CC  | Carry set                  | C = 1               |
|  7   | CC       | Carry clear                | C = 0               |
|  8   | MI       | Minus / Negative           | N = 1               |
|  9   | PL       | Plus / Non-negative        | N = 0               |
| 10   | VS       | Overflow set               | V = 1               |
| 11   | VC       | Overflow clear             | V = 0               |
| 12   | HI       | Unsigned higher            | C = 1 and Z = 0     |
| 13   | LS       | Unsigned lower or same     | C = 0 or Z = 1      |
| 14   | AL       | Always (unconditional)     | (none)              |
| 15   | NV       | Never (no-op)              | (none — always skip)|

`AL` (always) is the normal unconditional form. `NV` is a no-op regardless of flags.

## 3. Register Files

### 3.1 Capability Registers (CR0–CR15)

Sixteen 64-bit capability registers. Each holds a **Guard Token (GT)**: a
type-tagged, permission-bearing, hardware-verified reference to an object.

| Range    | Name                 | Notes                                          |
|----------|----------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| CR0–CR5  | User CRs             | General-purpose; caller context preserved by CALL |
| CR6      | C-list root          | E-permission token for current abstraction's c-list; re-derived by CALL/RETURN |
| CR7–CR11 | User CRs             | General-purpose; caller context preserved by CALL |
| CR12     | Thread stack         | Privileged; system-wide; unchanged by CALL/RETURN; only writeable via CHANGE |
| CR13     | Interrupt handler    | Privileged; system-wide; only writeable via SWITCH (hardware: PassKey gate) |
| CR14     | Code register (CLOOMC) | Privileged; per-thread; set by CALL, re-derived by RETURN; X-only |
| CR15     | Namespace root       | Privileged; per-thread; only writeable via SWITCH (hardware: PassKey gate) |

**Privilege zone**: CR12–CR15 cannot appear as operands in LOAD, SAVE, TPERM,
LAMBDA instructions. CALL, RETURN, CHANGE, and SWITCH are the only Church-domain
instructions that touch them.

### 3.2 Data Registers (DR0–DR15)

Sixteen 32-bit integer registers.

> **A.1 — DR0 is hardwired zero.**
>
> DR0 reads as 0 at all times. After every instruction that produces a result,
> the simulator unconditionally writes 0 to DR0 (`simulator.js` line 2748:
> `this._writeDR(0, 0)`). Writes targeting DR0 are silently discarded — the
> value is immediately overwritten back to 0.
>
> This enables two universal idioms, replacing MOV and load-immediate opcodes
> that would otherwise need their own encodings:
>
> | Idiom | Instruction | Effect |
> |-------|-------------|--------|
> | Register copy | `IADD DRd, DR0, DRs` | DRd ← DRs |
> | Load immediate | `IADD DRd, DR0, #k` | DRd ← k (0 ≤ k ≤ 16383) |
>
> Any instruction that writes a computed result into DR0 (e.g., `IADD DR0, DR1, DR2`)
> always reads back 0 on the next instruction. This is not a bug — it is the
> intended architectural property. Do not use DR0 as a scratch register.

### 3.3 Permission Bits (GT word0)

The permission field of a GT encodes the following access rights:

| Bit | Symbol | Meaning                                      |
|-----|--------|----------------------------------------------|
|  30 | E      | Execute — may call the abstraction            |
|  29 | S      | Save — may store a GT into this object's c-list |
|  28 | L      | Load — may load a GT from this object's c-list |
|  27 | X      | Code — execute raw instructions from lump memory |
|  26 | W      | Write — may write data words into lump memory |
|  25 | R      | Read — may read data words from lump memory   |
|  31 | B      | Busy — object lock; clearable by TPERM B-modifier |

**Domain purity rule**: X may not coexist with L, S, or E in the same GT's
effective permission set. A GT that would combine X with any of L/S/E is invalid
and causes TPERM to fault with `TPERM_RSV` when the combination is tested.

---

## 4. HALT / NOP (all-zero word)

```
Encoding: 0x00000000
Assembler aliases: HALT, NOP
```

The all-zero word is architecturally the instruction `LOAD AL, CR0, CR0, #0`
— a conditional LOAD that would load CR0 from `CR0[0]`. In practice, an
all-zero instruction word is used to mark the end of a code region.

**Simulator behaviour:** an all-zero word encountered during execution triggers
a warm reboot sequence, not a halt. Execution does not pause cleanly; the boot
ROM re-runs. Writers of code lumps should never allow execution to fall through
to an all-zero word unless a reboot is the intended outcome.

---

---

## 5. Flag Behaviour — Quick Reference

Four flags: **N** (negative), **Z** (zero), **C** (carry), **V** (overflow).

> **A.2 — BFEXT and BFINS do write flags: N and Z reflect the result; C and V are always cleared.**
>
> Hardware (`core.py` lines 1140–1143, 1169–1172) sets N = result[31],
> Z = (result == 0), C = 0, V = 0 for both instructions. The simulator
> (`_execBfext`, `_execBfins`) matches this behaviour.
>
> This means a BFEXT result can be tested directly with a conditional branch:
>
> ```
> BFEXT  DR1, DR2, 0, 8      ; extract byte — Z = 1 if byte is zero
> BRANCH EQ, handle_zero     ; correctly tests the extracted byte
> ```
>
> Note that C and V are **cleared**, not preserved. Any preceding instruction's
> carry or overflow flag is lost after BFEXT or BFINS.

Flag-writing summary across all 20 instructions:

| Instruction | N | Z | C | V | Notes |
|-------------|---|---|---|---|-------|
| LOAD        | — | — | — | — | |
| SAVE        | — | — | — | — | |
| CALL        | — | — | — | — | |
| RETURN      | — | — | — | — | |
| CHANGE      | — | — | — | — | |
| SWITCH      | — | — | — | — | |
| TPERM       | ✓ | ✓ | 0 | 0 | N = !Z; C and V always cleared |

| SHR         | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | 0 | C = last bit shifted out (source[shamt-1], 0 if shamt=0); imm[5]=0→LSR, imm[5]=1→ASR (sign-extend). V always 0. Hardware confirmed (Task #857) |

---

## 6. Cross-Cutting Encoding Rules

### A.3 — SHR: bit 5 selects ASR vs LSR; A.4 — BRANCH: bit 14 is the sign bit

> **A.3 — SHR imm15[5] = mode select.**
>
> `SHR DRd, DRs, #amt` encodes the shift amount in `imm15[4:0]` (0–31).
> `imm15[5]` selects the fill mode:
>
> | imm15[5] | Mode | Fill bit | Assembler suffix |
> |----------|------|----------|-----------------|
> | 0        | LSR  | 0        | (none)          |
> | 1        | ASR  | sign bit (DRs[31]) | `ASR` |
>
> Assembler syntax: `SHR DR1, DR2, #4` (LSR) or `SHR DR1, DR2, #4, ASR` (ASR).
> C = last bit shifted out. V = 0 always.
>
> **Simulator/hardware deviation (D-12, open):** The hardware currently implements
> LSR only (C = 0, no ASR mode). The simulator implements both correctly.
> Task #857 tracks the hardware fix.

> **A.4 — BRANCH: bit 14 of imm15 is the sign bit.**
>
> BRANCH uses all 15 bits of the imm15 field as a signed PC-relative word offset:
>
> ```
> soff  = (imm & 0x4000) ? (imm | 0xFFFF8000) : imm   ; sign-extend bit 14
> target = current_PC + soff                            ; word addressing
> ```
>
> Range: **−16384 to +16383 words** (±65536 bytes on byte-addressed hardware).
>
> Hardware sign-extension (Amaranth): `Cat(immediate, immediate[14].replicate(17))`
> then `nia += sign_extend(imm) × 4` — equivalent; byte vs word addressing only.
>
> **Key offsets:**
>
> | Offset | Effect |
> |--------|--------|
> | `#0`   | **Infinite loop** — branches back to itself (target = current PC) |
> | `#1`   | Fall-through — target = current_PC + 1 = next instruction (effectively a NOP branch) |
> | `#-1`  | Step back — target = previous instruction |
>
> **Assembler label resolution:** labels resolve at assemble time as
> `offset = label_word_index − branch_word_index`. The assembler is two-pass,
> so forward references (label appears after the branch) are legal. After
> encoding, every BRANCH imm is bounds-checked to fit in −16384..+16383;
> out-of-range offsets are a hard assembler error.
>
> **Runtime bounds:** the simulator faults immediately with BOUNDS if the target
> is outside the loaded memory image. Hardware detects the violation on the next
> instruction fetch via the CR14 code fence (`fetch_bounds_fault`).
>
> **Condition code is mandatory.** There is no bare `BRANCH label` form — the
> condition code is always present in the word encoding. Use `BRANCH AL, label`
> for an unconditional jump, or the alias mnemonics: `BRANCHEQ`, `BRANCHNE`,
> `BRANCHLT`, `BRANCHGE`, `BRANCHGT`, `BRANCHLE`, etc.

### A.5 — CALL: 1-based method index; A.6 — ELOADCALL: split imm15

> **A.5 — CALL imm15 is 1-based: user method index N encodes as imm15 = N + 1.**
>
> imm15 = 0 is the fast-path shorthand: NIA = lump_base + 4 (word 1, first
> instruction in the lump). The method table is bypassed entirely. This is the
> correct encoding for single-entry-point abstractions.
>
> imm15 > 0 is a table lookup: hardware reads `memory[lump_base + imm15 × 4]`
> to get the callee's first instruction word offset, then sets
> NIA = lump_base + entry × 4. A zero table entry → PRIVATE_METHOD FAULT.
>
> | What you write | imm15 encoded | Hardware does |
> |----------------|---------------|---------------|
> | `CALL CRn` (no selector) | 0 | Fast path: NIA = lump_base + 4 |
> | `CALL CRn, 0` | 1 | Table entry [1]: user method index 0 |
> | `CALL CRn, 1` | 2 | Table entry [2]: user method index 1 |
> | `CALL CRn, N` | N + 1 | Table entry [N+1]: user method index N |
>
> Assembler: named methods (`CALL CRn, MethodName`) are resolved from the
> registered method conventions table and encoded as `imm15 = method.index + 1`.
> Dot-notation (`CALL SlideRule.Multiply`) resolves the object binding and method
> name in one step. Numeric selector range: 0–16383 (imm15 range: 1–16384).
>
> **Disassembly note:** a disassembled CALL showing imm15 = 3 means user method
> index 2, not 3. Always subtract 1 from the raw imm15 field to get the user-facing
> method selector.

> **A.6 — ELOADCALL imm15 is split into two fields.**
>
> ```
> imm15[14:8]  =  method index (7 bits, 0–127)    — same 1-based encoding as CALL
> imm15[7:0]   =  c-list row   (8 bits, 0–255)    — word offset into CRsrc c-list
> ```
>
> ELOADCALL atomically loads the GT at `CRsrc[row]` into the destination CR and
> calls it with the given method index. The method index is encoded identically
> to CALL (0 = fast path, N+1 = user method N).
>
> **Backward compatibility:** old programs that encoded `ELOADCALL CRd, CRs, #N`
> with a simple row number stored the row in bits[7:0] and left bits[14:8] = 0.
> Method index 0 → fast path — behaviour is identical to the pre-split encoding.
>
> Valid ranges (enforced by assembler and checked at assembly time):
> - c-list row: 0–255 (8 bits; values 256+ are a hard assembler error)
> - method index: 0–126 in user terms → 0–127 in imm15[14:8] (value 127 rejected)

### A.7–A.11 — TPERM: preset table, NULL behaviour, domain-purity, B-modifier, flag invariants

> **TPERM preset encoding (imm15[4:0])**
>
> Bit 4 = B-modifier (see A.11). Bits [3:0] = preset code (0–15).
>
> | Code | Mnemonic | Permissions required | Reserved? |
> |------|----------|----------------------|-----------|
> | 0x00 | CLEAR    | none                 | No |
> | 0x01 | R        | R                    | No |
> | 0x02 | RW       | R, W                 | No |
> | 0x03 | X        | X                    | No |
> | 0x04 | RX       | R, X                 | No |
> | 0x05 | RWX      | R, W, X              | No |
> | 0x06 | L        | L                    | No |
> | 0x07 | S        | S                    | No |
> | 0x08 | E        | E                    | No |
> | 0x09 | LS       | L, S                 | No |
> | 0x0A | W        | W only (no R)        | No |
> | 0x0B–0x0F | — | —                   | **Reserved** |
>
> Adding 0x10 to any valid code sets the B-modifier: `TPERM CRd, RB` = code 0x11.
> All B-modifier variants of 0x0B–0x0F are also reserved.

> **A.7 — CLEAR (preset 0) always passes for any non-NULL, non-reserved GT.**
>
> `TPERM CRd, CLEAR` requires no permissions. Since the required set is empty,
> `required.every(p => gt.permissions[p])` is vacuously true. Z = 1 for any valid
> non-NULL GT regardless of what permissions it actually holds. This is the
> standard "GT is live and non-NULL" existence check.

> **A.8 — NULL GT always produces Z = 0, N = 1, no fault.**
>
> If `CR.word0 = 0` (NULL GT), TPERM immediately sets Z = 0, N = 1, C = 0, V = 0
> and returns — before checking the preset code, before the domain-purity check,
> before anything else. No fault is raised. This applies to every preset including
> CLEAR: `TPERM CRd, CLEAR` on a NULL GT gives Z = 0.
>
> Pattern to distinguish NULL from "lacks permission":
> ```
> TPERM  CR1, CLEAR        ; Z=1 → non-NULL; Z=0 → NULL
> BRANCH EQ, not_null
> ```

> **A.9 — Domain-purity violation → hard FAULT(TPERM_RSV).**
>
> If the *result* permission set (intersection of preset's required bits and the GT's
> held bits) would combine X with any of L, S, or E, TPERM faults with `TPERM_RSV`.
> This is a hard fault — not Z = 0, not recoverable.
>
> No built-in preset triggers this (presets are X-pure or LSE-pure, never mixed),
> but a GT that already combines X and L/S/E could trigger it on certain presets.
> In practice this guards against malformed GTs reaching code that uses them.

> **A.10 — TPERM flag invariants: N = !Z, C = 0, V = 0 always.**
>
> These three relationships hold unconditionally after every TPERM that does not
> fault. The flag table in §5 already captures this. Key implication: C and V are
> **always cleared** by TPERM — any preceding instruction's carry or overflow is
> lost.

> **A.11 — B-modifier (imm15 bit 4): clears the Busy bit on a passing test.**
>
> When bit 4 of the imm15 field is set and the permission test passes (Z = 1),
> TPERM clears bit 31 of `CR.word0` (the B "Busy" bit) **in place** — no namespace
> write, no SAVE needed. The change is local to the CR until a SAVE commits it.
>
> If the test fails (Z = 0), the B bit is left unchanged regardless of the modifier.
> The modifier has no effect on flags.
>
> ```
> TPERM  CR2, EB          ; test for E permission; if Z=1, clear B bit atomically
> BRANCH EQ, call_ok      ; Z=1: abstraction is callable and now marked un-busy
> ```
>
> **Reserved preset + B-modifier:** codes 0x1B–0x1F are reserved; behaviour
> matches A-13 (simulator: Z=0 no fault; hardware: FAULT — see D-3 in
> `HARDWARE-DEVIATIONS.md`).

### A.12–A.14 — Call stack: CALL frame layout, LAMBDA SZ=0, M-window writeback

> **A.12 — CALL pushes exactly 2 words to thread memory; no CRs or DRs.**
>
> When CALL executes, it writes two words into the current thread's lump memory
> at the stack pointer (STO):
>
> | Word offset (from STO) | Contents |
> |------------------------|----------|
> | STO      | Frame word: packed (returnPC[14:0] \| sz[12] \| flags[11:8] \| savedSTO[7:0]) |
> | STO − 1  | Caller's E-GT (CR6 value before the call) |
>
> `sz = 1` distinguishes CALL frames from LAMBDA frames (sz = 0). No capability
> registers or data registers are written to thread memory — the callee inherits
> all DRs and CRs from the caller (with the exception of CR6 and CR14, which
> are replaced by the callee's c-list and code tokens).
>
> The JS-side simulator call stack (`callStack[]`) additionally holds a snapshot
> of all saved registers for state inspection, but this is not part of the
> hardware frame format.

> **A.13 — LAMBDA pushes a SZ=0 (1-word) frame; RETURN identifies it by sz.**
>
> LAMBDA writes only the frame word (sz = 0) to thread memory — no E-GT slot.
> RETURN distinguishes frame types by the sz field:
>
> | sz | Frame type | Pop size | Return address source |
> |----|------------|----------|-----------------------|
> | 0  | LAMBDA     | 1 word   | `lambdaReturnPC` cache (no memory read) |
> | 1  | CALL       | 2 words  | Frame word in thread memory |
>
> The leaf-lambda fast path: when `lambdaActive = 1` and the frame popped is SZ=0,
> RETURN restores PC from the cached `lambdaReturnPC` register without a memory
> read. This gives O(1) RETURN at any recursion depth.
>
> LAMBDA CR6 idempotent re-entry (D-9): re-executing `LAMBDA CR6` while
> `lambdaActive = 1` is non-faulting (same return address overwrites the same
> register). `LAMBDA CRn` (n ≠ 6) while `lambdaActive = 1` → FAULT.

> **A.14 — M-window writeback fires at every CALL and every RETURN.**
>
> When an abstraction is called via an Abstract GT (M-bit = 1), hardware tracks
> modified namespace state in a 3-register M-window (DR11–DR13). Before the
> callee's frame is pushed (CALL) or before the caller's frame is popped (RETURN),
> the M-window writeback fires: DR11–DR13 are written back to the CR15 namespace
> entry and the M-bit is cleared.
>
> If the writeback fails (e.g. NULL DR11, invalid state), CALL and RETURN both
> fault with `INVALID_OP` before any frame manipulation occurs. The frame stack
> is never left in a partially-modified state.

### A.15–A.16 — BFINS source masking; LOAD short form

> **A.15 — BFINS uses only the low `width` bits of DRs.**
>
> The value inserted is `DRs & ((1 << width) - 1)`. Upper bits of DRs beyond
> `width` are discarded before insertion. The destination word is modified as:
>
> ```
> mask     = ((1 << width) - 1) << pos
> new_word = (old_DRd & ~mask) | ((DRs & ((1<<width)-1)) << pos)
> ```
>
> There is no alignment requirement — `pos` and `width` may be any values
> satisfying `width ≥ 1` and `pos + width ≤ 32`.

> **A.16 — LOAD (and SAVE, ELOADCALL, XLOADLAMBDA) short form uses CR6 implicitly.**
>
> Two-operand forms resolve the named abstraction from the assembler's NS binding
> table and substitute CR6 as the c-list base:
>

### A.17 — TPERM Mode 2: capability attenuation (`imm15 = 0x7FFF`)

> **A.17 — `TPERM CRd, CRs, 0x7FFF` attenuates CRd's GT to the permission subset held in CRs.**
>
> When `imm15 = 0x7FFF` (all 15 immediate bits set), TPERM enters **Mode 2
> (attenuation)** instead of the normal preset-test path. The two-register form
> uses:
>
> | Field  | Role |
> |--------|------|
> | `CRd`  | Source GT — the full-authority capability being attenuated (read and written) |
> | `CRs`  | Permission template — GT whose permission bits specify the desired narrower set |
>
> **Semantics:**
>
> 1. If `CRd.word0 = 0` (NULL source GT): Z = 0, N = 1, C = 0, V = 0. Return. No fault.
> 2. Parse permission bits from `CRd` (source) and `CRs` (requested subset).
> 3. **Subset validation:** for every permission bit set in `CRs`, verify the same
>    bit is also set in `CRd`. If any bit in `CRs` is absent from `CRd`, the caller
>    is attempting to *expand* authority beyond what they hold — Z = 0, N = 1,
>    C = 0, V = 0. `CRd` is **not** modified. Return. No hard fault.
> 4. **Construct attenuated GT:** copy `CRd`'s NS index, version (`gt_seq`), and
>    GT type; replace the permission bits with those from `CRs`.
> 5. Write the attenuated GT to `CRd`.
> 6. Z = 1, N = 0, C = 0, V = 0.

>
> **Identity attenuation** (`CRs` has the same permissions as `CRd`) is valid and

> (same permissions and NS metadata).
>
> **NULL `CRs`** (template GT word = 0) requests zero permissions (CLEAR). This is
> a valid strict subset of any non-NULL source: Z = 1, and `CRd` receives a
> zero-permission GT with the source's NS metadata.
>
> **B-modifier and domain-purity checks** do not apply to Mode 2. Those checks

### LOAD — Load Capability (opcode 0, 0x00)

```
Syntax:  LOAD CRd, CRs, #row
         LOAD CRd, Name          (shorthand: CRs = CR6, row = NS slot — see A.16)
Encoding: op[4:0]=0x00 | cond[4] | CRd[4] | CRs[4] | row[15]
```

**Semantics:** Loads the 32-bit GT word from the c-list addressed by CRs at word offset `row` into `CRd`. The full NS entry is then read and installed into CRd's three-word cache (word0=GT, word1=NS Word 1, word2=NS seals).

- **CRs = CR6** (c-list root): mLoad validates version and CRC seal; L permission check is skipped because CALL already validated E before the call frame was created.
- **CRs ≠ CR6**: mLoad validates L permission on CRs itself, reads the lump header to locate the c-list region, then validates the slot.
- **Abstract GT in slot**: installed directly into CRd without an NS table lookup (hardware device handle path).
- **Outform GT in slot**: triggers lazy-load (Mode 1 or Mode 2); NS entry is promoted Outform→Inform on completion.

**Flags:** N — Z — C — V (no flag writes)

**Faults:**
| Fault | Condition |
|-------|-----------|
| `NULL_CAP` | CRs is NULL, or c-list slot at `row` is 0 |
| `PERM` | CRs lacks L permission (except when CRs = CR6) |
| `BOUNDS` | `row` is outside the c-list range |
| `SEAL` | NS entry CRC-16 validation fails |
| `F_BIT` | Source GT is in a Far namespace (F=1) |
| `CODE_NOT_RESIDENT` | Outform lazy-load failed |

**Example:** Load the abstraction at c-list row 5 from CR6 into CR0.
```
LOAD AL, CR0, CR6, #5    ; opcode=0, cond=14, fld_a=0, fld_b=6, imm=5
                          ; encoding: 0x07030005
```

---

### SAVE — Save Capability (opcode 1, 0x01)

```
Syntax:  SAVE CRd, CRs, #row
         SAVE CRd, Name          (shorthand: CRs = CR6, row = NS slot — see A.16)
Encoding: op[4:0]=0x01 | cond[4] | CRd[4] | CRs[4] | row[15]
```

**Field roles** (note: reversed vs. what "destination" usually implies):
- **CRd** — the c-list pointer. Must hold a GT with **S (Save) permission**. This is the c-list that will be written.
- **CRs** — the GT to save. Must have **B = 1** (Bindable bit). A GT with B = 0 cannot be delegated.

**Semantics:** Writes the GT held in CRs into the c-list pointed to by CRd at word offset `row`. mSave validates: version seal on CRd, S permission on CRd, B=1 on CRs, and the F-bit policy on the target slot. The namespace entry is not touched — only the c-list word is written.

**Flags:** N — Z — C — V (no flag writes)

**Faults:**
| Fault | Condition |
|-------|-----------|
| `NULL_CAP` | CRd or CRs is NULL |
| `PERM` | CRd lacks S permission, or CRs has B = 0 |
| `BOUNDS` | `row` is outside the c-list range |
| `SEAL` | CRd NS entry CRC fails |
| `F_BIT` | Target slot has F = 1 (far-bit, cross-namespace) |

**Example:** Save the GT in CR1 to c-list row 3 of CR0's c-list.
```
SAVE AL, CR0, CR1, #3    ; CRd=CR0 (S perm), CRs=CR1 (B=1), row=3
                          ; opcode=1, cond=14, fld_a=0, fld_b=1, imm=3
                          ; encoding: 0x0F008003
```

---

### CALL — Enter Abstraction (opcode 2, 0x02)

```
Syntax:  CALL CRs [, #method_index]
         CALL CRs, MethodName     (named method — assembler resolves to 1-based index)
         CALL Name.Method         (dot-notation shorthand)
Encoding: op[4:0]=0x02 | cond[4] | CRs[4] | 0[4] | method[15]
```

**Method index encoding** (see A.5):
- `imm15 = 0` → fast path: NIA = lump_base + 4 (word 1, skips method table)
- `imm15 = N` → hardware reads `memory[lump_base + N×4]`; result is lump-relative word offset; 0 entry = PRIVATE_METHOD FAULT

**Semantics:**
1. M-window writeback fires (if M-flag set); faults `INVALID_OP` if writeback fails.
2. mLoad validates E permission on CRs GT; derives callee lump base, c-list address, and code address.
3. Push 2-word call frame to thread stack (see A.12):
   - `memory[STO]` = frame word (packed returnPC, sz=1, flags, savedSTO)
   - `memory[STO-1]` = caller's E-GT (CR6 value before call)
4. CR6 ← callee c-list GT (E-only). CR14 ← callee code GT (X-only, privileged).
5. PC ← NIA (lump_base + method entry, or lump_base + 4 for fast path).

Callee inherits DR0–DR15, CR0–CR5, CR7–CR11 from the caller. CR12 and CR13 are system-wide (unchanged). CR15 is per-thread (unchanged by CALL itself — restored by RETURN).

**Flags:** N — Z — C — V (no flag writes)

**Faults:**
| Fault | Condition |
|-------|-----------|
| `NULL_CAP` | CRs is NULL |
| `PERM` | CRs lacks E permission (unless Abstract GT — bypasses E check) |
| `SEAL` | NS entry CRC fails |
| `STACK_OVERFLOW` | STO would write into heap/DR zone |
| `F_BIT` | Far-namespace GT (checked before M-window writeback) |
| `PRIVATE_METHOD` | Method table entry at `imm15` is 0 |
| `INVALID_OP` | M-window writeback failed |

**Example:** Enter the abstraction in CR1 via fast path (single entry point).
```
CALL AL, CR1             ; imm=0 → NIA = lump_base + 4
                          ; opcode=2, cond=14, fld_a=1, fld_b=0, imm=0
                          ; encoding: 0x17080000
```

---

### RETURN — Return from Abstraction (opcode 3, 0x03)

```
Syntax:  RETURN [#mask]
Encoding: op[4:0]=0x03 | cond[4] | 0[4] | 0[4] | mask[12] | 0[3]
```

`mask` is a 12-bit field in `imm15[11:0]`. Bit N = 1 → CR_N is cleared to NULL after context restore. Bit 6 is architecturally reserved (CR6 is always restored from the frame E-GT; clearing it via mask is undefined). Bare `RETURN` (mask = 0) is fully backward-compatible.

**Semantics** (see A.12, A.13):
1. M-window writeback fires; faults `INVALID_OP` if writeback fails.
2. Call stack is checked; empty stack or sentinel frame → `STACK_UNDERFLOW`.
3. All M-bits are reset across all CRs (`_resetAllMBits`).
4. Frame is popped:
   - **SZ = 1 (CALL frame):** caller's CRs and DRs are restored from the saved snapshot; returnPC comes from the frame word.
   - **SZ = 0 (LAMBDA frame):** PC is restored from `lambdaReturnPC` cache without a memory read (O(1) fast path). `lambdaActive` is cleared.
5. mask is applied: each bit-N=1 CRs is written to NULL in one parallel operation.
6. PC ← returnPC.

**Flags:** N — Z — C — V (no flag writes; caller's flags are restored from the saved snapshot)

**Faults:**
| Fault | Condition |
|-------|-----------|
| `STACK_UNDERFLOW` | Call stack empty, or RETURN through boot sentinel frame (NIA = 0x7FFF) |
| `INVALID_OP` | M-window writeback failed before frame pop |

**Example:** Return, clearing CR0 and CR1 (mask = 0b000000000011 = 0x003).
```
RETURN AL, #0x003        ; mask bits 0 and 1 set → CR0, CR1 ← NULL
                          ; opcode=3, cond=14, fld_a=0, fld_b=0, imm=3
                          ; encoding: 0x1F000003
```
Bare return (no clearing):
```
RETURN AL                 ; mask=0 → no CRs cleared
                          ; encoding: 0x1F000000
```

---

### CHANGE — Thread Context Switch (opcode 4, 0x04)

```
Syntax:  CHANGE CR12, CR12, #idx
Encoding: op[4:0]=0x04 | cond[4] | CRd[4] | CRs[4] | idx[15]
```

**Assembler restriction:** The assembler only permits `CRd = CR12` and `CRs = CR12` (both operands reference the thread-stack register). All other privilege-zone registers (CR13–CR15) are blocked at the assembler level. The hardware is broader: CRd may be any of CR12–CR15 and drives different behaviour.

**Semantics by destination register (hardware):**
- **CR12 or CR13** (system-wide): Load GT directly from c-list at `CRs[idx]`; no per-thread save/restore.
- **CR14 or CR15** (per-thread): Full context switch — save the current thread's per-thread registers (CR0–CR11, CR14, CR15, DR0–DR15, STO, PC, flags) to the current thread lump; load the incoming thread's saved state from its lump. First activation of a thread starts at PC = 0.

**Flags:** N — Z — C — V (no flag writes)

**Faults:**
| Fault | Condition |
|-------|-----------|
| `PRIV_REG` | CRd < 12 (destination is not a privileged register) |
| `PERM` | CRs lacks required permission for the target type |
| `NULL_CAP` | Source c-list slot is NULL |

**Example:** Switch to thread at NS index 7 (both operands are CR12 per assembler convention).
```
CHANGE AL, CR12, CR12, #7   ; opcode=4, cond=14, fld_a=12, fld_b=12, imm=7
                              ; encoding: 0x27660007
```

---

### SWITCH — PassKey-Gated Privileged Write (opcode 5, 0x05)

```
Syntax:  SWITCH CRn, #target
Encoding: op[4:0]=0x05 | cond[4] | 0[4] | CRn[4] | target[3] | 0[12]
```

`target` is a 3-bit value in `imm15[2:0]`. Valid target values: `5` (CR13, interrupt handler) and `7` (CR15, namespace root).

**Hardware semantics** (reference: `hardware/switch.py`):
1. **Target validity check**: `target` must be 5 or 7 — any other value → `FAULT(INVALID_OP)`.
2. **Source range check**: CRn index (from fld_b) must be in range 0–7.
3. **PassKey type check**: `CRn` must hold an Abstract GT (`gt_type == 0b11`). Any Inform, Outform, or NULL GT → `FAULT(INVALID_OP)`.
4. **Sentinel check**: `CRn.word1_location` must equal the hardware-reserved sentinel for the chosen target: `0xFFFFFFFE` for CR13, `0xFFFFFFFF` for CR15. Mismatch → `FAULT(INVALID_OP)`.
5. On all checks passing: `ChurchMLoad` writes the source capability into the target privileged register with `m_elevated = 1`; G-bit is reset. **The source CR is not cleared** — this is a one-way install, not a swap.

**Simulator semantics** (`_execSwitch`, line ~3836): performs an **atomic CR swap** (`CRn ↔ CR[target]`) with only a NULL check. No PassKey check, no target-validity check, no sentinel check, no mLoad. See D-11 in `HARDWARE-DEVIATIONS.md`.

**Flags:** N — Z — C — V (no flag writes)

**Faults (hardware only):**
| Fault | Condition |
|-------|-----------|
| `INVALID_OP` | target ≠ 5 and target ≠ 7 |
| `INVALID_OP` | CRn not an Abstract GT |
| `INVALID_OP` | CRn sentinel address does not match target |
| `NULL_CAP` | CRn is NULL (simulator only) |

**Example:** Install a PassKey into CR15 (namespace root).
```
SWITCH AL, CR2, #7       ; CRn=CR2 (must be Abstract GT with sentinel 0xFFFFFFFF)
                          ; opcode=5, cond=14, fld_a=0, fld_b=2, imm=7
                          ; encoding: 0x2F010007
```

---

### TPERM — Test/Attenuate Permission (opcode 6, 0x06)

```
Syntax:  TPERM CRd, preset
         TPERM CRd, presetB        (B-modifier variant, e.g. EB, RWB)
Encoding: op[4:0]=0x06 | cond[4] | CRd[4] | 0[4] | preset[5] | 0[10]
```

`preset` is a 5-bit value in `imm15[4:0]`. Bit 4 = B-modifier; bits [3:0] = preset code:

| Code | Name | Required permissions |
|------|------|---------------------|
| 0x00 | CLEAR | none (vacuously true) |
| 0x01 | R | R |
| 0x02 | RW | R, W |
| 0x03 | X | X |
| 0x04 | RX | R, X |
| 0x05 | RWX | R, W, X |
| 0x06 | L | L |
| 0x07 | S | S |
| 0x08 | E | E |
| 0x09 | LS | L, S |
| 0x0A | W | W only (no R) |
| 0x0B–0x0F | — | **Reserved** |

B-modifier variants (bit 4 = 1): add 0x10 to any valid code (e.g. `EB = 0x18`). The B-modifier clears the Busy bit in CRd when the permission test passes.

**Semantics** (in order):
1. **NULL check**: if `CRd.word0 == 0` → Z=0, N=1, C=0, V=0, return immediately (no fault).
2. **Reserved preset check**: if preset code (bits[3:0]) is `0x0B–0x0F` → Z=0, N=1, C=0, V=0. Hardware additionally faults with `TPERM_RSV` (see D-3 in `HARDWARE-DEVIATIONS.md`).
3. **Domain-purity check**: if the intersection of the preset's required permissions and the GT's held permissions would combine X with any of L/S/E → `FAULT(TPERM_RSV)`.
4. **Permission test**: `hasAll = required_permissions.every(p => GT.permissions[p])`.
5. **B-modifier**: if bit 4 is set and `hasAll == true` → clear bit 31 of `CRd.word0` (the Busy bit) in place.
6. Set flags: Z = hasAll, N = !hasAll, C = 0, V = 0.

**Flags:** N = !Z, Z = (all required permissions present), C = 0 (always), V = 0 (always)

**Faults:**
| Fault | Condition |
|-------|-----------|
| `TPERM_RSV` | Result permissions would combine X with L/S/E (domain-purity violation) |

Note: reserved preset codes (0x0B–0x0F) are a hard fault on hardware but produce Z=0 in the simulator (see D-3).

**Example:** Test for E permission; clear B-bit if present.
```
TPERM AL, CR1, EB        ; preset EB = 0x18 (E=0x08 | B-modifier=0x10)
BRANCH EQ, call_ok       ; Z=1 → CR1 has E permission and B was cleared
                          ; opcode=6, cond=14, fld_a=1, fld_b=0, imm=0x18
                          ; encoding: 0x37080018
```

Test for R permission (existence of a readable data object):
```
TPERM AL, CR2, R         ; preset R = 0x01
                          ; opcode=6, cond=14, fld_a=2, fld_b=0, imm=1
                          ; encoding: 0x37100001
```

**Mode 2 (attenuation sentinel):** `imm15 = 0x7FFF` triggers permission
attenuation rather than a preset test — see A.17 in §6.

---

### LAMBDA — Execute Code Object in Caller Scope (opcode 7, 0x07)

```
Syntax:  LAMBDA CRn
Encoding: op[4:0]=0x07 | cond[4] | CRn[4] | 0[4] | 0[15]
```

**Semantics:**
1. mLoad validates X permission on CRn's GT. Faults if NULL or lacks X.
2. M-window cache is flushed (`_flushLambdaCache`).
3. A **SZ=0 frame** (1 word) is written to the thread stack: `memory[STO] = frameWord` (see A.13). No E-GT word is pushed.
4. `lambdaActive` ← 1. `lambdaReturnPC` ← PC + 1 (instruction after LAMBDA).
5. PC ← NIA derived from CRn's lump (code executes within the **caller's c-list context** — CR6 is not changed). CR14 is also unchanged; the lambda shares the caller's code fence.

LAMBDA does not switch c-lists. The callee inherits the caller's CR6. This is the defining difference from CALL.

**Idempotent re-entry rule (D-9):** `LAMBDA CR6` while `lambdaActive = 1` is permitted and idempotent (same return address overwrites the same register). `LAMBDA CRn` (n ≠ 6) while `lambdaActive = 1` is a FAULT.

**Flags:** N — Z — C — V (no flag writes)

**Faults:**
| Fault | Condition |
|-------|-----------|
| `NULL_CAP` | CRn is NULL |
| `PERM` | CRn's GT lacks X permission |
| `BOUNDS` | STO would write into heap/DR zone (stack overflow) |
| `FAULT` | `LAMBDA CRn` (n ≠ 6) while `lambdaActive = 1` |

**Example:** Execute reduction code referenced by CR3.
```
LAMBDA AL, CR3           ; opcode=7, cond=14, fld_a=3, fld_b=0, imm=0
                          ; encoding: 0x3F180000
```

---

### ELOADCALL — Fused Load + Call (opcode 8, 0x08)

```
Syntax:  ELOADCALL CRd, CRs, #row [, #method]
         ELOADCALL CRd, Name [, Method]    (shorthand — see A.6 and A.16)
Encoding: op[4:0]=0x08 | cond[4] | CRd[4] | CRs[4] | method[7] | row[8]
```

`imm15[14:8]` = method index (7 bits, 1-based; 0 = fast path).
`imm15[7:0]` = c-list row (8 bits, 0–255).

**Semantics:** Atomic LOAD + CALL. No intermediate CR state is visible between the two phases.
1. mLoad validates CRs's c-list for the row slot (L permission check as per LOAD semantics).
2. GT at `CRs[row]` is loaded; Outform GTs are promoted Outform→Inform.
3. mLoad validates E permission on the loaded GT.
4. CRd ← loaded GT.
5. Hardware CALL phase executes: push 2-word frame, set CR6/CR14, jump to callee entry. Method index is decoded from `imm15[14:8]` using the same 1-based encoding as CALL.

Backward compatibility: programs that encode `imm15[14:8] = 0` get the fast-path (NIA = lump_base + 4) — identical to pre-split behaviour.

**Flags:** N — Z — C — V (no flag writes)

**Faults:** All faults from LOAD and CALL apply. Additionally:
| Fault | Condition |
|-------|-----------|
| `BOUNDS` | `row` > 255 (assembler-enforced; hardware checks via c-list bounds) |

**Example:** Load abstraction from c-list row 2 of CR6 into CR0, then call it via fast path.
```
ELOADCALL AL, CR0, CR6, #2    ; row=2, method=0 (fast path)
                                ; opcode=8, cond=14, fld_a=0, fld_b=6, imm=0x0002
                                ; encoding: 0x43030002
```

---

### XLOADLAMBDA — Fused Load + Lambda (opcode 9, 0x09)

```
Syntax:  XLOADLAMBDA CRd, CRs, #row
         XLOADLAMBDA CRd, Name       (shorthand — see A.16)
Encoding: op[4:0]=0x09 | cond[4] | CRd[4] | CRs[4] | row[15]
```

**Semantics:** Atomic LOAD + LAMBDA. Equivalent to `LOAD CRd, CRs, #row` followed by `LAMBDA CRd`, but the two operations are indivisible — no intermediate CR state is visible.

1. Load GT from `CRs[row]` into CRd (same as LOAD — L permission check, mLoad validation).
2. LAMBDA phase: mLoad validates X permission on the loaded GT; push SZ=0 frame; set `lambdaActive`, `lambdaReturnPC`; PC jumps to callee code within the **caller's c-list** (CR6 unchanged).

XLOADLAMBDA is used to invoke shared code objects (reducers, helpers) referenced in an abstraction's c-list without switching context.

**Flags:** N — Z — C — V (no flag writes)

**Faults:** All faults from LOAD and LAMBDA apply.

**Example:** Load and execute the reduction at c-list row 7.
```
XLOADLAMBDA AL, CR1, CR6, #7  ; opcode=9, cond=14, fld_a=1, fld_b=6, imm=7
                                ; encoding: 0x4B038007
```

### DREAD — Data Read (opcode 10, 0x0A)

```
Syntax:  DREAD DRd, CRs, #offset
Encoding: op[4:0]=0x0A | cond[4] | DRd[4] | CRs[4] | offset[15]
```

**Semantics:** Read a 32-bit word from the data object referenced by CRs at word offset `offset` into `DRd`.

- **CRs requires R permission** (exception: when CRs = CR14, X permission is accepted in place of R — this allows reading embedded `WORD` constants from the current code lump via the code register).
- mLoad validates: permission, version, CRC seal, and that `lump_base + offset` lies within the GT's bounds.
- `DRd` is written via `_writeDR`, which enforces the DR0 hardwired-zero rule (A.1).
- **Abstract GT intercept**: if CRs holds an Abstract GT (type = 0b11), the read is routed to the Abstract Manager — MMIO device registers (LED, UART, TIMER, BUTTON) are accessed this way.

**Flags:** N — Z — C — V (no flag writes)

**Faults:**
| Fault | Condition |
|-------|-----------|
| `NULL_CAP` | CRs is NULL |
| `PERM` | CRs lacks R permission (or X when CRs = CR14) |
| `BOUNDS` | `lump_base + offset` is outside the GT's allowed range |
| `SEAL` | NS entry CRC fails |

**Example:** Read word 3 from the data object in CR2 into DR1.
```
DREAD AL, DR1, CR2, #3   ; opcode=10, cond=14, fld_a=1, fld_b=2, imm=3
                           ; encoding: 0x57090003
```

Read inline data constant from current lump (CR14 path):
```
data_val:  WORD 0x1234
; ...
DREAD AL, DR0, CR14, #data_val   ; offset = label word index; X permission accepted
```

---

### DWRITE — Data Write (opcode 11, 0x0B)

```
Syntax:  DWRITE DRd, CRs, #offset
Encoding: op[4:0]=0x0B | cond[4] | DRd[4] | CRs[4] | offset[15]
```

**Semantics:** Write the 32-bit value in `DRd` to the data object referenced by CRs at word offset `offset`.

- **CRs requires W permission**. mLoad validates: W permission, version, CRC, bounds.
- The value written is `DR[DRd] >>> 0` (unsigned 32-bit).
- **Thread sync**: if `DRd < 16`, the written value is also mirrored to the DR home slot in the thread lump (`thread_base + 1 + DRd`) so the thread image stays coherent across context switches.
- **Abstract GT intercept**: if CRs holds an Abstract GT (type = 0b11), the write is routed to the Abstract Manager (MMIO device write).
- **CR14 restriction**: CR14 is X-only; DWRITE to CR14 will fail the W-permission check.

**Flags:** N — Z — C — V (no flag writes)

**Faults:**
| Fault | Condition |
|-------|-----------|
| `NULL_CAP` | CRs is NULL |
| `PERM` | CRs lacks W permission |
| `BOUNDS` | `lump_base + offset` outside GT's allowed range |
| `SEAL` | NS entry CRC fails |
| `NULL_CAP` | CR12 (thread stack) is NULL when `DRd < 16` (cannot sync DR home) |

**Example:** Write DR0 to offset 0 of the data object in CR1.
```
DWRITE AL, DR0, CR1, #0   ; opcode=11, cond=14, fld_a=0, fld_b=1, imm=0
                            ; encoding: 0x5F008000
```

### BFEXT — Bit-Field Extract (opcode 12, 0x0C)

```
Syntax:  BFEXT DRd, DRs, #pos, #width
Encoding: op[4:0]=0x0C | cond[4] | DRd[4] | DRs[4] | pos[5] | width[5] | 0[5]
```

`imm15[9:5]` = `pos` (5-bit, 0–31 — LSB of the extracted field).
`imm15[4:0]` = `width` (5-bit, 1–32 — number of bits to extract).

**Semantics:** Extract `width` bits from `DRs` starting at bit `pos` (LSB) into `DRd`, zero-extended to 32 bits.

```
mask  = (1 << width) - 1
DRd   = (DRs >>> pos) & mask        ; bits[pos + width - 1 : pos]
```

Constraints: `width ≥ 1` and `pos + width ≤ 32` (faults `BOUNDS` otherwise).

Flags are written (see A.2): N = result[31], Z = (result == 0), C = 0, V = 0. Since a single-byte field can never have bit 31 set, N is effectively always 0 for widths < 32.

**Flags:** N = result[31], Z = (result == 0), C = 0, V = 0

**Faults:**
| Fault | Condition |
|-------|-----------|
| `BOUNDS` | `width == 0` or `pos + width > 32` |

**Example:** Extract byte 0 (bits [7:0]) of DR2 into DR1.
```
BFEXT AL, DR1, DR2, #0, #8  ; pos=0, width=8
                              ; imm = (0 << 5) | 8 = 0x0008
                              ; opcode=12, cond=14, fld_a=1, fld_b=2, imm=8
                              ; encoding: 0x67090008
```

---

### BFINS — Bit-Field Insert (opcode 13, 0x0D)

```
Syntax:  BFINS DRd, DRs, #pos, #width
Encoding: op[4:0]=0x0D | cond[4] | DRd[4] | DRs[4] | pos[5] | width[5] | 0[5]
```

Same imm15 layout as BFEXT: `imm15[9:5]` = pos, `imm15[4:0]` = width.

**Semantics:** Insert the low `width` bits of `DRs` into `DRd` at bit position `pos`. Bits of DRs beyond `width` are discarded (see A.15).

```
mask    = ((1 << width) - 1) << pos
DRd_new = (DRd & ~mask) | ((DRs & ((1 << width) - 1)) << pos)
DRd     ← DRd_new
```

Flags reflect the **entire new value of DRd** (not just the inserted bits): N = DRd_new[31], Z = (DRd_new == 0), C = 0, V = 0.

**Flags:** N = DRd_new[31], Z = (DRd_new == 0), C = 0, V = 0

**Faults:**
| Fault | Condition |
|-------|-----------|
| `BOUNDS` | `width == 0` or `pos + width > 32` |

**Example:** Insert the low 4 bits of DR3 into DR2 at bit position 8.
```
BFINS AL, DR2, DR3, #8, #4  ; pos=8, width=4
                              ; imm = (8 << 5) | 4 = 0x0104
                              ; opcode=13, cond=14, fld_a=2, fld_b=3, imm=0x104
                              ; encoding: 0x6F118104
```

---

### MCMP — Integer Compare (opcode 14, 0x0E)

```
Syntax:  MCMP DRd, DRs
Encoding: op[4:0]=0x0E | cond[4] | DRd[4] | DRs[4] | 0[15]
```

**Semantics:** Compute `DRd − DRs` and set condition flags. **No result register is written.** This is a pure flag-setting instruction.

```
temp = DRd - DRs
N = temp[31]
Z = (temp == 0)
C = (DRd_unsigned >= DRs_unsigned)   ; borrow flag (C=1 means no borrow)
V = signed overflow of DRd - DRs
```

The flag semantics match ISUB exactly (they share `_setSubFlags`). MCMP is the canonical compare instruction for use before a conditional BRANCH or conditional suffix.

**Flags:** N, Z, C, V — all written (subtraction semantics)

**Faults:** None

**Example:** Compare DR1 with DR2, then branch if equal.
```
MCMP AL, DR1, DR2        ; flags set from DR1 - DR2
BRANCH EQ, equal_path    ; branch if Z=1 (DR1 == DR2)
                          ; opcode=14, cond=14, fld_a=1, fld_b=2, imm=0
                          ; encoding: 0x77090000
```

---

### IADD — Integer Add (opcode 15, 0x0F)

```
Syntax:  IADD DRd, DRs, DRt      (register form)
         IADD DRd, DRs, #k        (immediate form, 0 ≤ k ≤ 16383)
Encoding (register): op[4:0]=0x0F | cond[4] | DRd[4] | DRs[4] | 0[11] | DRt[4]
Encoding (immediate): op[4:0]=0x0F | cond[4] | DRd[4] | DRs[4] | 1[1] | k[14]
```

`imm15[14] = 1` → immediate mode; `imm15[13:0]` = k (0–16383, unsigned).
`imm15[14] = 0` → register mode; `imm15[3:0]` = DRt index.

**Semantics:**
- Register form: `DRd = DRs + DRt` (unsigned 32-bit addition with flag capture)
- Immediate form: `DRd = DRs + k`

All arithmetic is 33-bit wide internally; the low 32 bits are stored in DRd; bit 32 drives the C flag.

Idioms enabled by DR0 = 0 (A.1):
- `IADD DRd, DR0, #k` → `DRd ← k` (load small immediate, 0–16383)
- `IADD DRd, DR0, DRs` → `DRd ← DRs` (register copy)

**Note on negative immediate:** `#-1` is not directly encodable (immediate is unsigned 14 bits: 0–16383). To load −1, use `ISUB DRd, DR0, #1`.

**Flags:** N = result[31], Z = (result == 0), C = carry out (bit 32), V = signed overflow

**Faults:** None

**Example:** Add DR1 and the constant 10, store in DR2.
```
IADD AL, DR2, DR1, #10   ; immediate form: imm = 0x4000 | 10 = 0x400A
                           ; opcode=15, cond=14, fld_a=2, fld_b=1, imm=0x400A
                           ; encoding: 0x7F10C00A
```

Load immediate 42 into DR5:
```
IADD AL, DR5, DR0, #42   ; DR0 = 0 always; result = 0 + 42 = 42
                           ; encoding: 0x7F28000A... (imm=0x4000|42=0x402A)
```

---

### ISUB — Integer Subtract (opcode 16, 0x10)

```
Syntax:  ISUB DRd, DRs, DRt      (register form)
         ISUB DRd, DRs, #k        (immediate form, 0 ≤ k ≤ 16383)
Encoding (register): op[4:0]=0x10 | cond[4] | DRd[4] | DRs[4] | 0[11] | DRt[4]
Encoding (immediate): op[4:0]=0x10 | cond[4] | DRd[4] | DRs[4] | 1[1] | k[14]
```

Immediate encoding identical to IADD: `imm15[14] = 1` → immediate, `imm15[13:0]` = k.

**Semantics:**
- Register form: `DRd = DRs − DRt`
- Immediate form: `DRd = DRs − k`

Carry flag semantics: `C = 1` when `DRs_unsigned ≥ DRt_unsigned` (no borrow). This matches ARM convention: C is the complement of the borrow bit.

Idiom: `ISUB DRd, DR0, #1` → `DRd ← −1` (all-ones, 0xFFFFFFFF), since DR0 = 0.

**Flags:** N = result[31], Z = (result == 0), C = (DRs ≥ DRt unsigned), V = signed overflow

**Faults:** None

**Example:** Subtract 1 from the loop counter in DR3.
```
ISUB AL, DR3, DR3, #1    ; DR3 ← DR3 - 1; sets Z=1 when DR3 reaches 0
                           ; opcode=16, cond=14, fld_a=3, fld_b=3, imm=0x4001
                           ; encoding: 0x831BC001
```

---

### BRANCH — Conditional PC-Relative Branch (opcode 17, 0x11)

```
Syntax:  BRANCH[cond] #offset        (signed integer offset)
         BRANCH[cond] label           (assembler resolves to signed offset)
Encoding: op[4:0]=0x11 | cond[4] | 0[4] | 0[4] | soff[15]
```

`imm15` is interpreted as a **signed 15-bit offset** with bit 14 as the sign bit (see A.4):
```
soff = (imm & 0x4000) ? (imm | 0xFFFF8000) : imm    ; sign-extend bit 14
PC   ← PC + soff                                      ; word addressing
```

Range: −16384 to +16383 words. BRANCH always requires a condition suffix — use `BRANCH AL` for unconditional. Condition code is encoded in bits[26:23] as usual; the instruction word has no "bare BRANCH" form.

The condition is tested on entry to this instruction. If the condition is false, BRANCH is skipped like any other instruction (PC += 1, no flags changed, no side effects).

Key offsets (see A.4):
- `#0` → infinite loop (target = current PC)
- `#1` → fall-through (target = PC + 1 = next instruction; effectively a NOP branch)
- `#-1` → step back to previous instruction

**Flags:** None written (flags are read, never modified)

**Faults:**
| Fault | Condition |
|-------|-----------|
| `BOUNDS` | `PC + soff` is outside the loaded memory image (simulator) or outside CR14 code fence (hardware) |

**Example:** Loop back to `loop_top` while DR1 ≠ 0.
```
loop_top:
    ISUB AL, DR1, DR1, #1
    BRANCH NE, loop_top   ; soff = loop_top_word − branch_word (negative)
                           ; cond=1 (NE), opcode=17
```

Unconditional forward jump by 3 words:
```
BRANCH AL, #3             ; opcode=17, cond=14, fld_a=0, fld_b=0, imm=3
                           ; encoding: 0x8B000003
```

---

### SHL — Shift Left (opcode 18, 0x12)

```
Syntax:  SHL DRd, DRs, #shamt     (0 ≤ shamt ≤ 31)
Encoding: op[4:0]=0x12 | cond[4] | DRd[4] | DRs[4] | 0[10] | shamt[5]
```

`imm15[4:0]` = shift amount (5 bits, 0–31). `imm15[14:5]` must be 0.

**Semantics:** Logical shift left. Zero-fill from the right.

```
DRd    = (DRs << shamt) & 0xFFFFFFFF    ; 32-bit result
C      = (shamt > 0) ? DRs[32 - shamt] : 0
                                          ; last bit shifted out (source[32-shamt])
N      = DRd[31]
Z      = (DRd == 0)
V      = 0 always
```

Hardware confirmed: C is the last bit shifted out of DRs, gated on shamt > 0 (Task #857, D-12).

**Flags:** N = result[31], Z = (result == 0), C = last bit shifted out (0 if shamt = 0), V = 0

**Faults:** None

**Example:** Shift DR2 left by 4, store in DR1.
```
SHL AL, DR1, DR2, #4     ; opcode=18, cond=14, fld_a=1, fld_b=2, imm=4
                           ; encoding: 0x97090004
```

---

### SHR — Shift Right (opcode 19, 0x13)

```
Syntax:  SHR DRd, DRs, #shamt              (LSR — logical, zero-fill)
         SHR DRd, DRs, #shamt, ASR         (ASR — arithmetic, sign-extend)
Encoding: op[4:0]=0x13 | cond[4] | DRd[4] | DRs[4] | 0[9] | mode[1] | shamt[5]
```

`imm15[4:0]` = shift amount (0–31). `imm15[5]` = mode select: 0 = LSR, 1 = ASR (see A.3).

**Semantics:**
```
; LSR (mode=0):
DRd = DRs >>> shamt            ; zero-fill from the left
C   = (shamt > 0) ? DRs[shamt - 1] : 0

; ASR (mode=1):
DRd = sign_extend(DRs) >> shamt   ; sign-fill from the left (bit 31 propagated)
DRd = DRd & 0xFFFFFFFF
C   = (shamt > 0) ? DRs[shamt - 1] : 0
N   = DRd[31]
Z   = (DRd == 0)
V   = 0 always
```

Hardware deviation (D-12, **CLOSED**): the hardware previously implemented LSR only (imm[5] ignored, C = 0). Task #857 fixed the hardware to match the simulator. Both now implement ASR and the C flag correctly.

**Flags:** N = result[31], Z = (result == 0), C = last bit shifted out (0 if shamt = 0), V = 0

**Faults:** None

**Example:** Logical right shift DR2 by 3.
```
SHR AL, DR1, DR2, #3     ; LSR, mode=0; imm = (0 << 5) | 3 = 0x03
                           ; opcode=19, cond=14, fld_a=1, fld_b=2, imm=3
                           ; encoding: 0x9F090003
```

Arithmetic right shift DR2 by 3 (sign-preserving):
```
SHR AL, DR1, DR2, #3, ASR   ; ASR, mode=1; imm = (1 << 5) | 3 = 0x23
                               ; encoding: 0x9F090023
```

### 8.2 Assembler Encoding Formula

```
word = ((opcode & 0x1F) << 27)
     | ((cond   & 0x0F) << 23)
     | ((fld_a  & 0x0F) << 19)
     | ((fld_b  & 0x0F) << 15)
     | ((imm    & 0x7FFF))

### 8.4 Design Question Notes (Group E)

The following open questions affect instruction behaviour but are not yet decided. They are tracked here to prevent spec ambiguity from silently propagating into implementations.

| ID | Instruction | Question | Current behaviour |
|----|-------------|----------|-------------------|
| E-1 | IADD / ISUB | Can `#-1` be encoded? | No — immediate is unsigned 0–16383. Use `ISUB DRd, DR0, #1` to get −1. |
| E-2 | RETURN | Is bit 6 of the mask reserved (CR6 always restored from frame)? | Assembler: no restriction. Hardware: CR6 is always re-derived by cload; mask bit 6 would be a no-op or clash. Decision pending. |
| E-3 | DREAD CR14 | Is X-in-place-of-R the only special case, or does a broader X→R substitution apply? | Simulator: CR14-specific only (`d.crSrc === 14`). Hardware: enforced by code-fence permission check. |
| E-4 | CHANGE | Assembler restricts both operands to CR12. Is this an architectural rule or only a toolchain convention? | Assembler restriction (assembler.js case 4). Hardware `change.py` is broader (any CR12–CR15 destination). Decision: document as assembler convention, not ISA restriction. |

**Deviation flags:** SWITCH (D-11), SHR/SHL carry+ASR (D-12, closed). TPERM reserved-preset fault (C.1, Task #873). TPERM Mode 2 (C.3, Task #874, closed).
