**Subject:** CIP Filing — Pure Church Lambda Machine: New Claims for CTMM Patent

---

Dear [Attorney Name],

I am writing regarding my pending CTMM patent application (filed February 12, 2026) to discuss a continuation-in-part (CIP) filing based on a significant new development in the architecture.

**Summary of Discovery**

Since filing, I have demonstrated that the Church domain of the CTMM architecture is computationally complete — meaning that all software can execute using only lambda calculus instructions, with zero Turing-domain instructions available to programs. This is not merely a theoretical observation; I have built three working proof implementations:

1. **HP-35 Scientific Calculator** — A complete recreation of the 1972 Hewlett-Packard HP-35, the world's first handheld scientific calculator, implemented in 179 instructions using exclusively Church-domain opcodes (LOAD, SAVE, CALL, RETURN, LAMBDA, TPERM). It performs all arithmetic, trigonometry (Taylor series), logarithms, exponentiation, and stack operations — zero ADD, SUB, MUL, MOV, CMP, or branch instructions.

2. **SlideRule Arithmetic Engine** — All 9 arithmetic operations (ADD, SUB, MUL, DIV, MOD, LOG, EXP, SQRT, POW) expressed in 98 pure Church-domain instructions using Church numeral encoding. Demonstrates that even low-level arithmetic can be performed entirely through capability-mediated lambda applications.

3. **Interactive Church Computer REPL** — A working Haskell implementation of the Pure Church Machine as an interactive programming environment. This goes beyond fixed programs to demonstrate a complete programming model: users can compose arbitrary Church-domain computations interactively, with every expression executing through the full 7-step capability-checked security pipeline. The REPL supports Ada Lovelace-style variable bindings — named intermediate results following the step-by-step programming style first described in her Note G (1843). A Bernoulli sum-of-squares program demonstrates multi-step mathematical computation (17 named variables, verifying 1²+2²+3²+4²=30 two ways) using only lambda calculus. Any Turing-domain instruction entered at the REPL produces an immediate FAULT.

**Why This Matters for Patentability**

The key insight is that **the architectural exclusion of Turing-domain instructions from software constitutes a security enforcement mechanism**. A processor built with only the six Church-domain opcodes cannot execute buffer overflows, return-oriented programming (ROP) chains, code injection, or privilege escalation attacks — because the instructions needed to perform those attacks (direct memory addressing, arbitrary branching, raw pointer arithmetic) do not exist in the instruction set.

This is distinct from existing prior art:
- **LISP machines** (MIT, Symbolics) reduced lambda expressions in hardware but retained full Turing instruction sets and had no capability security
- **Capability machines** (Cambridge CAP, IBM System/38, CHERI) enforce access control via capabilities but provide conventional Turing instruction sets for computation
- **Functional hardware** (Reduceron, GRIP) accelerate functional language execution but do not enforce security through the computational model itself

None of these used the absence of Turing instructions as a security mechanism.

**The Ada Lovelace Connection**

The REPL's programming model is notable: it reproduces Ada Lovelace's 1843 method of naming intermediate results in step-by-step computation — the style she used in Note G to describe the first computer program for Babbage's Analytical Engine. The Bernoulli sum-of-squares program explicitly follows this pattern, making it both a technical demonstration and an elegant historical connection: Lovelace described computation in terms that fit naturally on a machine where all operations are lambda calculus reductions, mediated by capability tokens. Her programming model anticipated the capability-secured lambda machine by 180 years.

**Proposed New Claims**

I have prepared a technical attachment (enclosed) outlining seven proposed new claims (Claims 17-23, continuing from the parent application's Claim 16) covering:

1. A pure Church lambda processor architecture excluding all Turing-domain instructions from the software instruction set
2. Security enforcement through architectural instruction exclusion (eliminating entire vulnerability classes by construction)
3. A hardware I/O mediator as the sole bridge between pure lambda software and physical devices
4. Church numeral method-selector dispatch (eliminating branch instructions and jump tables)
5. Church-encoded arithmetic operations mediated by capability tokens
6. A three-block processor architecture (lambda reducer, capability validator, I/O mediator)
7. An interactive programming model with Ada Lovelace-style named variable bindings, program file execution, and fail-safe error handling

**Evidence of Reduction to Practice**

Three software proofs are documented, verified, and timestamped in version control:
- The HP-35 and SlideRule implementations (verified by automated parsing — zero Turing instructions)
- The Church Computer REPL (Haskell, ~1,000 lines, 6 modules) with the Bernoulli demonstration program

The existing Amaranth HDL hardware implementation (Sim-32, ~3,150 lines) has been synthesized to FPGA (iCE40 HX8K: 1,982 LUTs, 26% utilization) and could be modified to a Church-only core.

**Requested Action**

I would appreciate your guidance on:
1. Whether these claims are best filed as a CIP of the existing application or as a separate application
2. Whether the reduction to practice (simulator proofs + synthesizable hardware) is sufficient, or whether an FPGA demonstration on physical hardware would strengthen the filing
3. Priority and timing considerations given that the proofs are now documented

Please find the detailed technical attachment enclosed. I am available to discuss at your convenience.

Best regards,
Kenneth James Hamer-Hodges
