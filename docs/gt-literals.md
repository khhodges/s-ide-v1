# GT Type Field and Domain Separation

> **Status**: Updated February 14, 2026. GT-Literal concept removed. Type field updated to reflect clean separation between Church domain (capabilities in CRs) and Turing domain (values in DRs).

## Overview

The Golden Token (GT) Type field is a 2-bit architectural classification that determines how every capability token is interpreted by hardware. It enforces the fundamental principle of the Church-Turing Meta-Machine: **capability registers (CRs) hold capabilities only, data registers (DRs) hold values only. No mixing.**

The removal of GT-Literals reflects the hard-won lesson from architecture design: the "oil and water" problem of mixing references and values in a single register representation adds complexity without sufficient value. The clean solution is structural separation, enforced by the Type field at every instruction.

---

## GT Type Field

The 2-bit Type field in every Golden Token classifies four categories:

| Value | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| 00 | **Inform** | Local reference — data or code in the local namespace. Requires dereferencing through mLoad: MAC validation, version check, permissions check, namespace lookup. |
| 01 | **Outform** | Remote reference — data or service at a network URL. Requires evaluation through HTTPS fetch/flush or RPC tunnel. |
| 10 | **NULL** | Empty/invalid/revoked capability — any operation FAULTs. The register holds no capability. |
| 11 | **Spare** | Reserved for future use — any operation FAULTs. |

### Inform (Type = 00)
A *local name* — a reference to a resource in the local namespace. The GT format holds:
- **Version** (7 bits): Cross-checked against the namespace entry to detect revocation
- **Index** (17 bits): The namespace table index
- **Permissions** (6 bits): Access rights (R, W, X, L, S, E)

Any instruction that uses an Inform GT goes through the mLoad validation path: MAC integrity check, version match, permission verification, namespace lookup. This ensures that every capability access is controlled, validated, and revocable.

### Outform (Type = 01)
A *remote name* — a reference to a resource at a network location (a URL, service endpoint, or RPC tunnel). The GT format is identical to Inform, but the hardware interprets the Index and Version differently:
- The **Index** encodes the network location or tunnel identifier
- Dereferencing goes through HTTPS fetch/flush or the RPC tunnel (if a cryptographic key is stored at that namespace entry)

Outform enables network-transparent access while maintaining capability-based security — the reference is unforgeable, and revocation is instant (version bump on garbage collection).

### NULL (Type = 10)
The *empty* or *invalid* capability state. Any operation on a NULL-typed GT causes an immediate FAULT:
- Load, save, call, branch, mLoad, or any other capability operation
- A clear diagnostic: the register holds no valid capability

NULL serves three architectural roles:

#### Initialization
When a thread is created, capability registers that are not explicitly loaded with valid GTs are initialized to NULL. This is unambiguous — the hardware knows the register holds nothing, rather than trying to interpret an uninitialized bit pattern.

#### Revocation
When a capability must be revoked (access withdrawn, resource deallocated, session terminated), the capability register is set to NULL. Any subsequent attempt to use the revoked capability FAULTs immediately, with a clear cause: the register holds NULL.

#### Garbage Collection
The NULL type allows the GC scanner to unambiguously distinguish empty registers from valid capabilities. A register holding all zeros could be confused with an Inform GT pointing to namespace index 0 with version 0 and no permissions — but Type = 10 (NULL) is unambiguous. The scanner knows immediately the register does not reference any namespace entry.

### Spare (Type = 11)
Reserved for future architectural extension. Like NULL, any operation on a Spare-typed GT causes an FAULT, preventing accidental use of undefined type encodings.

## Why GT-Literals Were Removed

The original GT-Literal concept (Type = 10, later replaced by NULL) attempted to embed a 30-bit value directly in a capability register by reclaiming the Version and Permissions fields as value bits. This approach had several fundamental problems:

### The "Oil and Water" Problem
Capability registers are designed to hold unforgeable references. Data registers are designed to hold values. The GT-Literal conflation tried to store values in CRs, mixing the two domains. This added complexity:
- Instructions like **LDL** (Load Literal) and **STL** (Store Literal) required new type checks at every use
- The LAMBDA instruction had to distinguish direct GT-Literals (self-contained values) from indirect GT-Literals (namespace-backed handles)
- Type ambiguity: what does a GT-Literal mean after register-to-register copy? It's still a 30-bit value, but now the context is lost

### The Lambda Register Window Problem
The proposal to alias capability registers CR12-CR15 to data registers x28-x31 as a "lambda register window" further compounded the mixing. This added:
- Register aliasing complexity — a single physical register with two architectural names and two interpretation paths
- Confusion in the programmer's mental model — is x28 a value or a reference?
- Potential security gaps — the aliasing would require careful scoping to prevent leakage of capability state through the data register interface

### Secrets and Credentials Don't Need GT-Literals
The original motivation for GT-Literals was compact storage of small secrets, authentication credentials, and API keys. But this is already handled cleanly by the namespace and mLoad:
- A secret lives in a namespace entry's Location and Limit fields
- A credential is accessed via a standard **CAP.LOAD** with **R permission**
- Revocation is instant — bumping the version invalidates all outstanding GTs pointing to that entry
- No special type or bit reclamation needed

### The Clean Separation is the Security
The architectural principle is simple: **mLoad is the single, trusted gate for all capability validation and access.** Every time a CR is read or written, mLoad checks:
- Is the GT valid? (Version matches, MAC validates)
- Are permissions present? (R, W, X, L, S, E bits checked)
- Is the resource available? (Namespace entry exists, not revoked)

This single gate eliminates special cases. Values live in DRs (no validation needed — they are data). References live in CRs (always validated through mLoad). No mixing, no ambiguity.

## NULL Type Benefits in Depth

### Unambiguous Initialization
A freshly created thread has all CRs set to NULL. There is no need for a sentinel value, no ad-hoc convention about "unused" registers, no confusion about whether a zero bit pattern is a valid capability or empty space. NULL is architecturally distinct and hardware-recognized.

### Clean, Deterministic Revocation
When a capability is revoked (e.g., a file is closed, a session ends, access is withdrawn), the CR holding that capability is set to NULL. Unlike stale capabilities (which might still be held by a thread but with an outdated version), NULL is immediately hostile — any instruction that touches a NULL register faults. This provides:
- Determinism: no silent failures with stale references
- Diagnostics: the FAULT clearly indicates a NULL capability, not a permission error or version mismatch
- No cleanup burden: the thread does not need to check or clear the register manually

### No Silent Failures
A NULL operation always results in a FAULT. This is superior to silent behavior:
- Use-after-free attempts FAULT immediately
- Uninitialized register access FAULTs immediately
- Revoked capability access FAULTs immediately

The alternative — silent no-ops or undefined behavior — is unacceptable in a security architecture.

### GC Scanning Without Ambiguity
The garbage collector must identify which registers hold live capabilities and which hold nothing. Without NULL:
- A register holding zero bits: is this a valid Inform GT (Type = 00, Version = 0, Index = 0, no Permissions) or an empty slot?
- The GC would have to use a separate "presence" bit or bitmap to track which registers are actually in use
- Revocation would require both setting a register to zero AND updating a presence bitmap

With NULL:
- Type = 10 unambiguously means "this register is empty" — the GC can skip it
- Type = 00 with Index = 0 unambiguously means "this register holds a valid Inform GT pointing to namespace index 0" — the GC must scan that capability
- No separate bitmap needed; the Type field alone is sufficient

## LAMBDA Instruction Overview

The **LAMBDA** instruction is the lightweight in-scope code application mechanism, as opposed to the heavyweight **CALL** instruction used for cross-domain service invocation.

### Format and Operands
```
LAMBDA CRn, x
```

- **CRn**: A capability register holding a Golden Token with **X (Execute) permission** pointing to executable code in the same protection domain (Inform type). This GT *is* Church's lambda — the code body λx.body.
- **x**: A data register holding the argument value. This is the bound variable.

### Semantics
LAMBDA applies the code body to the argument: `(λx.body)(arg)`. The result is returned in data registers by the code body (by convention, the first code instruction after the body execution).

### Key Characteristics

**X Permission, Same Domain**
- LAMBDA uses **X (Execute) permission**, not **E (Enter) permission**
- X permission is for code that executes within the current protection domain — the same C-List, the same capability context
- No domain crossing, no capability list switch, no new security context

**Arguments and Results in Data Registers**
- The argument is passed in a data register (Turing domain)
- The result is returned in a data register (Turing domain)
- Computation happens in the data register context; no capability passing needed for the internal call

**Church's Lambda, Directly Executed**
- The GT in CRn is not a reference to a function object — it *is* the function
- The Type field (Inform), permissions (X), and Index together name the code entry point
- Execution is direct: load the code, bind the argument, branch

**Machine-Status Fast Path**
- In the common case (LAMBDA → body → RETURN), zero stack accesses
- The return address (PC+4) and LAMBDA-active flag live in machine status registers, not the capability stack
- RETURN detects the LAMBDA-active flag and restores PC immediately — no frame pop, no mLoad revalidation, no domain context switching

**Non-Nestable on Its Own, Nestable via CALL**
- A second LAMBDA while LAMBDA-active is set causes a FAULT (non-nestable)
- But a CALL during a LAMBDA body saves the LAMBDA machine status and clears the LAMBDA-active flag, allowing a nested LAMBDA within the called domain
- This controlled nesting prevents runaway stack usage while allowing practical recursion and nested function calls

**Macro-Like Efficiency**
- The code exists once in memory (a single namespace entry)
- No code duplication, no code bloat
- Each invocation: 2 cycles of LAMBDA setup, plus the body execution time
- Compare to CALL (10+ cycles of domain crossing overhead) — LAMBDA is 5-7× faster for lightweight operations

## The Church-Turing Marriage

The architecture is built on the marriage of two computational models, each with its own domain:

### Church Domain: Capabilities in Capability Registers
- **The Question**: *What can I access?*
- **The Answer**: The Golden Tokens in CR0-CR15 name the resources
- **Semantics**: References, names, unforgeable tokens, protected by MAC and version
- **The Instruction**: **CALL** (E permission) crosses the domain boundary

### Turing Domain: Values in Data Registers
- **The Question**: *What do I compute?*
- **The Answer**: The numeric values in x0-x31 (32-bit) or x0-x63 (64-bit)
- **Semantics**: Data, computation, arithmetic, logic, branching
- **The Instruction**: **All RV32/RV64 instructions** operate in this domain

### Bridges Between Domains

**LAMBDA: Use a Capability to Execute Code on Values**
- Takes a capability (GT with X permission in CR) — the code body
- Takes a value (in a data register) — the argument
- Executes the code within the current protection domain
- Returns a value (computed by the code) in a data register
- No domain crossing, no capability list switch, lightweight overhead

**CALL: Invoke a Service Across Domains**
- Takes a capability (GT with E permission in CR) — the service entry point
- Invokes the service in a new protection domain (new C-List, new security context)
- Results are passed back via data registers (values) or capability registers (new references)
- Domain crossing, full validation, heavyweight overhead — but necessary for security boundaries

### mLoad: The Trusted Gate
- **mLoad** is the single validation function for all capability operations
- Every time a capability register is read or written, mLoad:
  - Checks the GT Version against the namespace entry
  - Validates the MAC seal (cryptographic integrity)
  - Verifies required permissions (R, W, X, L, S, E)
  - Looks up the namespace entry (resource data)
- This single gate ensures all capability access is controlled, validated, and revocable
- No capability ever "escapes" mLoad; no special cases or shortcuts

## Removed Concepts (for Historical Reference)

The following concepts were part of earlier architectural proposals and have been removed:

### Direct GT-Literal (Type = 10, Self-Contained Value)
A 30-bit value embedded in a capability register by reclaiming the Version and Permissions fields. Removed because:
- Mixed CR (reference) and DR (value) domains
- Created type ambiguity across register copies
- Added complexity without sufficient benefit

### Indirect GT-Literal (Namespace-Backed Handle)
A GT pointing to a namespace entry containing a secret value. Removed because:
- The same result is achieved with a standard Inform GT and CAP.LOAD with R permission
- No special type needed; the namespace already handles secrets securely
- The Type field is now available for other purposes (NULL, Spare)

### LDL Instruction (Load Literal)
Created a direct GT-Literal from a 30-bit immediate or data register value. Removed with the GT-Literal concept.

### STL Instruction (Store Literal)
Extracted the 30-bit value from a direct GT-Literal into a data register. Removed with the GT-Literal concept.

### Bit Reclamation (Version/Permissions as Value Bits)
The technique of reusing the Version and Permissions fields of the GT as storage for the 30-bit value. Removed because:
- Confused the architectural semantics — was the GT a reference or a value?
- Made type checking and validation ambiguous
- The clean separation (values in DRs, references in CRs) is more secure

### Lambda Register Window (CR12-CR15 Aliased to x28-x31)
A proposal to alias a range of capability registers to a range of data registers for lightweight lambda variable passing. Removed because:
- Register aliasing adds complexity without sufficient benefit
- The LAMBDA instruction itself provides the lightweight mechanism
- Aliasing risks security gaps if capability state leaks through the data register interface
- The clean separation is preserved better without aliasing

## Summary: Clean Architecture, Secure Defaults

The removal of GT-Literals and the clarification of the Type field reflect a maturation of the architecture:

1. **Separation of Concerns**: CRs hold capabilities (references); DRs hold values (data). No mixing, no ambiguity.

2. **NULL Type**: Provides unambiguous empty/invalid/revoked capability state, enabling clean initialization, safe revocation, and efficient garbage collection.

3. **LAMBDA Instruction**: Provides lightweight in-scope code application (X permission, same domain) as a complement to heavyweight cross-domain CALL (E permission, domain crossing).

4. **Single Validation Gate**: mLoad is the single, trusted validation function for all capability access — no shortcuts, no special cases, no silent failures.

5. **Secure Defaults**: All operations on NULL or Spare typed GTs result in FAULT. Uninitialized CRs are NULL, not unspecified. Revocation is deterministic.

This architecture achieves the Church-Turing marriage: the capability model (Church) provides protection and naming; the computational model (Turing) provides data and algorithms; LAMBDA bridges them for efficient, secure in-scope computation; CALL bridges them for secure cross-domain service invocation.
