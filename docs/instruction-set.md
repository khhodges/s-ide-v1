# Church Machine Instruction Set

## Encoding Format

All instructions are 32 bits:

```
31    27 26  23 22  19 18  15 14           0
|opcode | cond |  dst |  src |    imm15    |
| 5 bit | 4 bit| 4 bit| 4 bit|   15 bits   |
```

- **opcode** (5 bits): Instruction identifier (0–19)
- **cond** (4 bits): ARM-style condition code for conditional execution
- **dst** (4 bits): Destination register (CR0–CR15 or DR0–DR15)
- **src** (4 bits): Source register (CR0–CR15 or DR0–DR15)
- **imm15** (15 bits): Immediate value (signed or unsigned depending on instruction)

## Condition Codes

All instructions support conditional execution:

| Code | Mnemonic | Meaning | Flags |
|------|----------|---------|-------|
| 0000 | EQ | Equal | Z=1 |
| 0001 | NE | Not equal | Z=0 |
| 0010 | CS/HS | Carry set / unsigned higher or same | C=1 |
| 0011 | CC/LO | Carry clear / unsigned lower | C=0 |
| 0100 | MI | Minus (negative) | N=1 |
| 0101 | PL | Plus (positive or zero) | N=0 |
| 0110 | VS | Overflow set | V=1 |
| 0111 | VC | Overflow clear | V=0 |
| 1000 | HI | Unsigned higher | C=1 and Z=0 |
| 1001 | LS | Unsigned lower or same | C=0 or Z=1 |
| 1010 | GE | Signed greater or equal | N=V |
| 1011 | LT | Signed less than | N≠V |
| 1100 | GT | Signed greater than | Z=0 and N=V |
| 1101 | LE | Signed less or equal | Z=1 or N≠V |
| 1110 | AL | Always (unconditional) | — |
| 1111 | NV | Never (reserved) | — |

Append the condition suffix to any mnemonic: `CALLEQ`, `BRANCHNE`, `IADDGE`, etc.

## Church Domain (10 Instructions)

These instructions manipulate capabilities (Golden Tokens). They operate on Context Registers (CR0–CR15).

### LOAD (opcode 0)

```
LOAD CRd, CRs, #slot
```

Loads a Golden Token from the c-list pointed to by CRs at the given slot into CRd. Requires L (load) permission on the source GT. CR6-specific M-elevation: LOAD from CR6 skips L permission check because CALL already validated E.

**Security**: mLoad validates version, seal, bounds, L permission, and F-bit.

### SAVE (opcode 1)

```
SAVE CRd, CRs, #slot
```

Saves the GT in CRs to the c-list pointed to by CRd at the given slot. Requires S (save) permission on the target c-list. Source GT must have B=1 (bindable).

**Security**: mSave validates version, seal, bounds, S permission, B-bit, and F-bit on target slot.

### CALL (opcode 2)

```
CALL CRd
```

Enters the abstraction referenced by CRd. Requires E (enter) permission. Pushes current CR6, CR7, and PC onto the call stack. Loads target's c-list into CR6 and code (c-list[0]) into CR7. Sets PC=0. Clears B-bit on all preserved CRs.

### RETURN (opcode 3)

```
RETURN
```

Returns from the current abstraction. Pops saved CR6, CR7, and PC from the call stack. Shared between Church and Turing domains.

If the call stack is empty, RETURN triggers a reboot (warm restart) — not a halt.

### CHANGE (opcode 4)

```
CHANGE CRd, CRs
```

Copies a Context Register from CRs to CRd. Used to move Golden Tokens between register slots.

### SWITCH (opcode 5)

```
SWITCH CRd, CRs
```

Atomically swaps the contents of CRd and CRs. Used for thread context switching (swap CR8 for new thread identity).

### TPERM (opcode 6)

TPERM is the single-instruction GT health check. It shares one opcode across two modes — **health check** (flag-setting, no trap) and **permission restriction** (monotonic attenuation). The mode is determined by how the standard 32-bit encoding fields are used.

#### Encoding

Both modes use the standard 32-bit format:

```
31    27 26  23 22  19 18  15 14           0
|00110 | cond |  dst |  src |    imm15    |
  op=6   4-bit  4-bit  4-bit   15 bits
```

#### Mode 1 — Health Check (flag-setting)

```
TPERM CRs, #preset, offset
```

| Field | Usage |
|-------|-------|
| dst (4 bits) | CRs — the context register to check |
| src (4 bits) | Preset code — selects the permission mask to test (see table below) |
| imm15 (15 bits) | Offset — hardware checks `base + offset ≤ limit` |

**What the hardware checks (all at once, one cycle)**:
1. **Permissions** — does CRs have the requested permission bits?
2. **Valid** — does the GT pass version and MAC validation?
3. **Base + Limit** — is `base + offset` within the GT's region?

**Flags set**:
- **Z = 1**: all checks passed (permissions present, valid, in bounds)
- **Z = 0**: one or more checks failed

**No trap**: TPERM never faults. If checks fail, the Z flag says so and software decides what to do via conditional execution. The actual read/write instructions that follow enforce safety — an access to an invalid or out-of-bounds region will FAULT at that point. TPERM is the "ask first" instruction.

##### Conditional Execution: Zero-Cost Try-Catch

Because every Church Machine instruction carries a 4-bit ARM condition code, TPERM + conditional suffixes give you try-catch with no branches and no overhead on the happy path:

```
TPERM CR5, RW, offset      ; dst=CR5, src=preset 2 (RW), imm15=offset
                            ; Z=1 if all pass, Z=0 if any fail

; --- happy path (EQ suffix = fires only when Z=1) ---
readEQ DR1, CR5, offset     ; skipped if Z=0
IADDEQ DR2, DR1, 1          ; skipped if Z=0
writeEQ CR5, offset, DR2    ; skipped if Z=0
returnEQ                     ; return to caller — skipped if Z=0

; --- catch path (NE suffix = fires only when Z=0) ---
; Execution reaches here ONLY if TPERM set Z=0.
; Every EQ instruction above was silently skipped by hardware.
MOVNE  DR0, #0               ; set error code (0 = failed)
returnNE                      ; return error to caller
```

The happy path does not branch, does not check errors, does not even know failure is possible. Every instruction carries EQ and the hardware silently skips it if TPERM failed. The catch path runs on the same principle in reverse: NE instructions fire only when Z=0. Both paths execute in sequence with no branching — the condition code on every instruction determines whether the hardware executes or skips it.

**Execution trace when TPERM passes (Z=1)**:
```
TPERM    → Z=1
readEQ   → executes (Z=1 matches EQ)
IADDEQ   → executes
writeEQ  → executes
returnEQ → executes — caller gets result, never reaches catch
MOVNE    → skipped (Z=1 does not match NE)
returnNE → skipped
```

**Execution trace when TPERM fails (Z=0)**:
```
TPERM    → Z=0
readEQ   → skipped (Z=0 does not match EQ)
IADDEQ   → skipped
writeEQ  → skipped
returnEQ → skipped
MOVNE    → executes (Z=0 matches NE) — sets error code
returnNE → executes — caller gets error
```

No branches. No jumps. The hardware skips or executes each instruction based on the condition suffix alone.

#### Mode 2 — Permission Restriction (monotonic attenuation)

```
TPERM CRd, #preset
```

| Field | Usage |
|-------|-------|
| dst (4 bits) | CRd — the context register to attenuate |
| src (4 bits) | Preset code — permission mask to AND with current permissions |
| imm15 (15 bits) | 0 (no offset — distinguishes from health check) |

ANDs the preset mask with CRd's current permissions. Permissions can only be removed, never added (monotonic restriction). Sets Z=1 if resulting permissions are non-zero. The attenuation is local to the cached CR; the namespace slot is not updated until a SAVE commits it. Domain purity is enforced: Turing (R, W, X) and Church (L, S, E) permissions cannot be mixed.

#### Preset Table

Presets are split into two mutually exclusive groups matching domain purity:

**Turing domain** (R, W, X — data access and execution):

| Value | Name | Bits Set |
|-------|------|----------|
| 0 | CLEAR | None |
| 1 | R | R |
| 2 | RW | R, W |
| 3 | X | X |
| 4 | RX | R, X |
| 5 | RWX | R, W, X |

**Church domain** (L, S, E — capability list operations):

| Value | Name | Bits Set |
|-------|------|----------|
| 6 | L | L |
| 7 | S | S |
| 8 | E | E |
| 9 | LS | L, S |
| 10 | — | Reserved — E must be standalone (raises FAULT) |
| 11 | — | Reserved — E must be standalone (raises FAULT) |
| 12 | — | Reserved — E must be standalone (raises FAULT) |

**E isolation rule**: E (Execute — enter an abstraction) must never be combined with L (Load from c-list) or S (Save to c-list). Combining E with L or S in a single token would allow a holder to both traverse the nodal c-list and enter an abstraction with one capability, creating an attack path into the c-list structure. E is the entry key to a function; L and S are the keys to the capability list that owns it. Keeping them separate ensures that holding the ability to call something does not grant the ability to read or modify the c-list it came from.

Valid Church presets: L, S, E, LS. No preset may combine E with L or S.

No preset combines Turing and Church bits. Domain purity is a hardware invariant enforced at the instruction encoding level — a cross-domain or E-combined preset value is illegal and raises a FAULT.

B-modifier variants (add 0x10): RB, RWB, XB, EB, LSB — sets B-bit alongside a valid domain-pure permission set. LSB is the maximum Church c-list preset with bind.

#### Design Rationale

TPERM is the single gateway for inspecting and restricting GT metadata — permissions, validity, type, stack indicators, and bounds. Keeping all metadata operations in one opcode minimises opcode usage and silicon cost while providing a uniform interface. The two modes coexist in the same encoding: `imm15 > 0` triggers a bounds check (health-check mode); `imm15 = 0` with no offset performs attenuation (restriction mode). The flag-setting (no-trap) design enables the conditional execution try-catch pattern that gives the happy path zero overhead.

### LAMBDA (opcode 7)

```
LAMBDA CRd
```

Applies the code object referenced by CRd in the current scope. Requires X (execute) permission. Does not switch c-lists — executes target code with caller's capabilities. Saves current PC as lambda return point. Machine-status fast path available for single-instruction targets.

### ELOADCALL (opcode 8)

```
ELOADCALL CRd, CRs, #slot
```

Fused LOAD + CALL. Loads a GT from CRs's c-list at slot, then immediately enters it. Equivalent to `LOAD CRd, CRs, #slot` followed by `CALL CRd`, but atomic.

### XLOADLAMBDA (opcode 9)

```
XLOADLAMBDA CRd, CRs, #slot
```

Fused LOAD + LAMBDA. Loads a GT from CRs's c-list at slot, then immediately applies it. Equivalent to `LOAD CRd, CRs, #slot` followed by `LAMBDA CRd`, but atomic.

## Turing Domain (10 Instructions + shared RETURN)

These instructions process data. They operate on Data Registers (DR0–DR15) and access DATA objects via R/W-permissioned GTs.

### DREAD (opcode 10)

```
DREAD DRd, CRs, #offset
```

Reads a 32-bit word from the DATA object referenced by CRs at the given offset into DRd. Requires R (read) permission.

### DWRITE (opcode 11)

```
DWRITE CRd, DRs, #offset
```

Writes DRs to the DATA object referenced by CRd at the given offset. Requires W (write) permission.

### BFEXT (opcode 12)

```
BFEXT DRd, DRs, #width, #lsb
```

Extracts a bitfield from DRs. Width and LSB position are encoded in the immediate field.

### BFINS (opcode 13)

```
BFINS DRd, DRs, #width, #lsb
```

Inserts a bitfield from DRs into DRd at the specified position.

### MCMP (opcode 14)

```
MCMP DRd, DRs
```

Compares DRd and DRs, setting condition flags (N, Z, C, V) without storing a result. Used before conditional instructions.

### IADD (opcode 15)

```
IADD DRd, DRs, #imm
```

Integer addition. DRd = DRs + imm. Sets condition flags.

### ISUB (opcode 16)

```
ISUB DRd, DRs, #imm
```

Integer subtraction. DRd = DRs - imm. Sets condition flags.

### BRANCH (opcode 17)

```
BRANCH #offset
BRANCHEQ #offset
BRANCHNE #offset
```

Branches to PC + offset (signed). Always conditional-compatible. Offset is relative to the current instruction.

### SHL (opcode 18)

```
SHL DRd, DRs, #amount
```

Logical shift left. DRd = DRs << amount.

### SHR (opcode 19)

```
SHR DRd, DRs, #amount
```

Logical shift right. DRd = DRs >> amount.
