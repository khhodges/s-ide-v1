# Church Machine Instruction Set

**v1.0 — 2026-04-29**
**CONFIDENTIAL**

## Encoding Format

All instructions are 32 bits:

```
31    27 26  23 22  19 18  15 14           0
|opcode | cond |  dst |  src |    imm15    |
| 5 bit | 4 bit| 4 bit| 4 bit|   15 bits   |
```

- **opcode** (5 bits): Instruction identifier (0–19)
- **cond** (4 bits): ARM-style condition code for conditional execution
- **dst** (4 bits): Destination register (CR0–CR15 or DR0–DR15)
- **src** (4 bits): Source register (CR0–CR15 or DR0–DR15)
- **imm15** (15 bits): Immediate value (signed or unsigned depending on instruction)

## Condition Codes

All instructions support conditional execution:

| Code | Mnemonic | Meaning | Flags |
|------|----------|---------|-------|
| 0000 | EQ | Equal | Z=1 |
| 0001 | NE | Not equal | Z=0 |
| 0010 | CS/HS | Carry set / unsigned higher or same | C=1 |
| 0011 | CC/LO | Carry clear / unsigned lower | C=0 |
| 0100 | MI | Minus (negative) | N=1 |
| 0101 | PL | Plus (positive or zero) | N=0 |
| 0110 | VS | Overflow set | V=1 |
| 0111 | VC | Overflow clear | V=0 |
| 1000 | HI | Unsigned higher | C=1 and Z=0 |
| 1001 | LS | Unsigned lower or same | C=0 or Z=1 |
| 1010 | GE | Signed greater or equal | N=V |
| 1011 | LT | Signed less than | N≠V |
| 1100 | GT | Signed greater than | Z=0 and N=V |
| 1101 | LE | Signed less or equal | Z=1 or N≠V |
| 1110 | AL | Always (unconditional) | — |
| 1111 | NV | Never (reserved) | — |

Append the condition suffix to any mnemonic: `CALLEQ`, `BRANCHNE`, `IADDGE`, etc.

## Church Domain (10 Instructions)

These instructions manipulate capabilities (Golden Tokens). They operate on Context Registers (CR0–CR15).

### LOAD (opcode 0)

```
LOAD CRd, CRs, #row
```

Loads a Golden Token from the c-list pointed to by CRs at the given row (word offset) into CRd. Requires L (load) permission on the source GT. CR6-specific M-elevation: LOAD from CR6 skips L permission check because CALL already validated E.

**Security**: mLoad validates version, seal, bounds, L permission, and F-bit.

### SAVE (opcode 1)

```
SAVE CRd, CRs, #row
```

Saves the GT in CRs (source GT, B=1 required) to the c-list pointed to by CRd (destination c-list pointer, S permission required) at the given row (word offset).

- **CRd** — destination c-list pointer. Must have S (save) permission.
- **CRs** — source GT to save. Must have B=1 (bindable). A GT without B=1 cannot be delegated.

**Security**: mSave validates version, seal, bounds, S permission on CRd, B-bit on CRs, and F-bit on the target slot.

### CALL (opcode 2)

```
CALL CRs [, #method_index]
```

Enters the abstraction identified by the E-GT in CRs. CALL pushes **2 words** onto the call stack:
- **Word 0** — the caller's E-GT (used by RETURN to revalidate and re-derive CR6/CR14)
- **Word 1** — NIA (return offset) | packed machine indicators

No DRs and no other CRs are pushed. Callee inherits DR0–DR15, CR0–CR5, CR7–CR11, CR15 (caller context); CR12/CR13 are system-wide and unchanged. Sets CR6 = callee c-list (E-only), CR14 = callee code (X-only, privileged, M=1).

**Method index dispatch** (imm15 field):

| imm15 | NIA |
|---|---|
| 0 | lump_base + 4 (word 1 — single entry point, no method table) |
| n > 0 | hardware reads `memory[lump_base + n×4]`; result is lump-base-relative word offset → NIA = lump_base + offset×4. Result = 0 → private method → FAULT. |

**PC = 0 always FAULTs** — the lump header (word 0) is never a valid entry point.

### RETURN (opcode 3)

```
RETURN [mask]
```

**Encoding**: `opcode[5]=00011 | cond[4] | 0[11] | mask[12]`

`mask` is a 12-bit literal in bits [11:0]. The mask field is currently **not implemented** in hardware — all bits are ignored. Bit 6 is **reserved and must be 0**: CR6 is always re-derived unconditionally by cload regardless of the mask. All other mask bits (0–5, 7–11) are also unimplemented and must be 0. Use bare `RETURN` (mask=0). Encoding a non-zero mask will produce no error on current hardware but the clearing does not occur.

**Execution order**:
1. Pop 2-word frame
2. mLoad caller's E-GT (Word 0) — version + MAC + G-bit reset; NS split re-derives CR6 and CR14
3. Restore PC from NIA and machine indicators from Word 1
4. Apply mask — all marked CRs written to NULL in **one parallel clock edge** (mask bits fan into CR register-file write enables; zero overhead regardless of how many bits are set)

Note: CR5 is a thread-bound capability installed by CHANGE from Zone④ bounds when a thread is resumed; it is not saved or restored by CALL/RETURN.

**Why the mask is programmer-declared**: GTs are first-class values — a callee may legitimately return a GT in CR0. Only the programmer knows which CRs carry return values vs. internal working state. The mask is emitted as a compile-time literal by the [CLOOMC](https://sipantic.blogspot.com/2025/03/xx.html) compiler from a `clear:` annotation.

DRs and non-masked CRs retain whatever values the callee left. Shared between Church and Turing domains.

If the call stack is empty, or if RETURN unwinds through the boot sentinel frame (NIA = 0x7FFF), RETURN faults with `STACK_UNDERFLOW` — not a reboot, not a halt. The "warm reboot" description in older documents is incorrect.

### CHANGE (opcode 4)

```
CHANGE CRd, CRs, idx
```

Privileged register write. Reads the GT at index `idx` in CRs's c-list and installs it into privileged register CRd (CR12–CR15 only; PRIV_REG fault if CRd < 12).

- **CR12/CR13** (system-wide): direct write; no context switch. CR12 = thread stack; CR13 = interrupt handler.
- **CR14/CR15** (per-thread): full context switch — saves CR0–CR11, CR14, CR15, DRs, and PC into the current thread lump; loads the target thread's saved state. First activation starts at PC=0.

### SWITCH (opcode 5)

```
SWITCH CRn, CRs
```

PassKey-gated privileged register write. Validates CRs as a system-capability Abstract GT with the hardware sentinel address for the target slot, then writes it into privileged CR12–CR15. Valid targets: CR13 (Tgt=101₂ = interrupt handler) and CR15 (Tgt=111₂ = namespace root). All other Tgt values produce INVALID_OP.

### TPERM (opcode 6)

TPERM is the single-instruction GT health check. It shares one opcode across two modes — **health check** (flag-setting, no trap) and **permission restriction** (monotonic attenuation). The mode is determined by how the standard 32-bit encoding fields are used.

#### Encoding

Both modes use the standard 32-bit format:

```
31    27 26  23 22  19 18  15 14           0
|00110 | cond |  dst |  src |    imm15    |
  op=6   4-bit  4-bit  4-bit   15 bits
```

#### Mode 1 — Health Check (flag-setting)

```
TPERM CRs, #preset, offset
```

| Field | Usage |
|-------|-------|
| dst (4 bits) | CRs — the context register to check |
| src (4 bits) | Preset code — selects the permission mask to test (see table below) |
| imm15 (15 bits) | Offset — hardware checks `base + offset ≤ limit` |

**What the hardware checks (all at once, one cycle)**:
1. **Permissions** — does CRs have the requested permission bits?
2. **Valid** — does the GT pass version and MAC validation?
3. **Base + Limit** — is `base + offset` within the GT's region?

**Flags set**:
- **Z = 1**: all checks passed (permissions present, valid, in bounds)
- **Z = 0**: one or more checks failed

**Faulting**: TPERM faults with `TPERM_RSV` if the preset code is reserved (codes 11–15 and their B-modifier variants 0x1B–0x1F). For all valid presets, TPERM does not fault — if a permission check fails the Z flag says so and software decides what to do via conditional execution. The actual LOAD/SAVE/CALL instructions that follow enforce safety. TPERM is the "ask first" instruction.

##### Conditional Execution: Zero-Cost Try-Catch

Because every Church Machine instruction carries a 4-bit ARM condition code, TPERM + conditional suffixes give you try-catch with no branches and no overhead on the happy path:

```
TPERM CR5, RW, offset      ; dst=CR5, src=preset 2 (RW), imm15=offset
                            ; Z=1 if all pass, Z=0 if any fail

; --- happy path (EQ suffix = fires only when Z=1) ---
readEQ DR1, CR5, offset     ; skipped if Z=0
IADDEQ DR2, DR1, 1          ; skipped if Z=0
writeEQ CR5, offset, DR2    ; skipped if Z=0
returnEQ                     ; return to caller — skipped if Z=0

; --- catch path (NE suffix = fires only when Z=0) ---
; Execution reaches here ONLY if TPERM set Z=0.
; Every EQ instruction above was silently skipped by hardware.
MOVNE  DR1, #0               ; set error code (0 = failed)
returnNE                      ; return error to caller
```

The happy path does not branch, does not check errors, does not even know failure is possible. Every instruction carries EQ and the hardware silently skips it if TPERM failed. The catch path runs on the same principle in reverse: NE instructions fire only when Z=0. Both paths execute in sequence with no branching — the condition code on every instruction determines whether the hardware executes or skips it.

**Execution trace when TPERM passes (Z=1)**:
```
TPERM    → Z=1
readEQ   → executes (Z=1 matches EQ)
IADDEQ   → executes
writeEQ  → executes
returnEQ → executes — caller gets result, never reaches catch
MOVNE    → skipped (Z=1 does not match NE)
returnNE → skipped
```

**Execution trace when TPERM fails (Z=0)**:
```
TPERM    → Z=0
readEQ   → skipped (Z=0 does not match EQ)
IADDEQ   → skipped
writeEQ  → skipped
returnEQ → skipped
MOVNE    → executes (Z=0 matches NE) — sets error code
returnNE → executes — caller gets error
```

No branches. No jumps. The hardware skips or executes each instruction based on the condition suffix alone.

#### Mode 2 — Permission Restriction (monotonic attenuation)

```
TPERM CRd, #preset
```

| Field | Usage |
|-------|-------|
| dst (4 bits) | CRd — the context register to attenuate |
| src (4 bits) | Preset code — permission mask to AND with current permissions |
| imm15 (15 bits) | 0x7FFF — all-ones sentinel; distinguishes restriction from health-check and allows health-check at offset 0 |

ANDs the preset mask with CRd's current permissions. Permissions can only be removed, never added (monotonic restriction). Sets Z=1 if resulting permissions are non-zero. The attenuation is local to the cached CR; the namespace slot is not updated until a SAVE commits it. Domain purity is enforced: Turing (R, W, X) and Church (L, S, E) permissions cannot be mixed.

#### Preset Table

| Code | Name | Bits Checked |
|------|------|--------------|
| 0 | CLEAR | None (always Z=1 if GT is non-NULL) |
| 1 | R | R |
| 2 | RW | R, W |
| 3 | X | X |
| 4 | RX | R, X |
| 5 | RWX | R, W, X |
| 6 | L | L |
| 7 | S | S |
| 8 | E | E |
| 9 | LS | L, S |
| 10–15 | (reserved) | **FAULT** (`TPERM_RSV`) — hard fault, not Z=0 |

**E isolation**: E permission must not be combined with L or S in a single GT. E grants entry into an abstraction as a black box; L or S grant c-list visibility. A holder of both could inspect or modify the abstraction's hidden implementation — violating encapsulation. Codes 10 (LE), 11 (SE), 12 (LSE) are therefore reserved. Codes 13–15 are reserved for cross-domain and other reasons.

**B-modifier** (bit 4 of preset code): Adding B (0x10) clears the B-bit in the GT on a passing check — e.g. `TPERM CR5, EB` (code 0x18) checks E permission and, if it passes, clears the Bind bit. Named B-variants: RB, RWB, XB, RXB, RWXB, LB, SB, EB, LSB.

**NULL GT rule**: If the GT in CRd is NULL (word0=0), TPERM always sets Z=0 with no fault.

#### Design Rationale

TPERM is the single gateway for inspecting and restricting GT metadata — permissions, validity, type, stack indicators, and bounds. Keeping all metadata operations in one opcode minimises opcode usage and silicon cost while providing a uniform interface. The two modes coexist in the same encoding: `imm15 = 0x7FFF` (all fifteen bits set) is the restriction sentinel — it performs monotonic attenuation with no bounds check. Any other imm15 value (0–32766) is a health-check offset, including 0 (test the base address). The all-ones sentinel was chosen over 0 precisely to allow offset=0 as a valid health-check target. The flag-setting (no-trap) design enables the conditional execution try-catch pattern that gives the happy path zero overhead.

### LAMBDA (opcode 7)

```
LAMBDA CRd
```

Applies the code object referenced by CRd in the current scope. Requires X (execute) permission. Does not switch c-lists — executes target code with caller's capabilities. Saves current PC as lambda return point. Machine-status fast path available for single-instruction targets.

### ELOADCALL (opcode 8)

```
ELOADCALL CRd, CRs, #row [, #method_index]
```

Fused LOAD + CALL. Loads a GT from CRs's c-list at the given row (word offset), then immediately enters it. Atomic: no intermediate CR state is visible between the LOAD and the CALL.

imm15 split: bits[7:0] = c-list row (word offset into the c-list of CRsrc, 0–255); bits[14:8] = method index passed to the hardware CALL phase (same semantics as CALL imm15, 0–127).

Existing programs encode bits[14:8]=0 → method index 0 → NIA = lump_base + 4 (backward compatible).

### XLOADLAMBDA (opcode 9)

```
XLOADLAMBDA CRd, CRs, #row
```

Fused LOAD + LAMBDA. Loads a GT from CRs's c-list at the given row (word offset), then immediately applies it. Equivalent to `LOAD CRd, CRs, #row` followed by `LAMBDA CRd`, but atomic.

## Turing Domain (10 Instructions + shared RETURN)

These instructions process data. They operate on Data Registers (DR0–DR15) and access DATA objects via R/W-permissioned GTs.

### DREAD (opcode 10)

```
DREAD DRd, CRs, #offset
```

Reads a 32-bit word from the DATA object referenced by CRs at the given offset into DRd. Requires R (read) permission.

### DWRITE (opcode 11)

```
DWRITE CRd, DRs, #offset
```

Writes DRs to the DATA object referenced by CRd at the given offset. Requires W (write) permission.

### BFEXT (opcode 12)

```
BFEXT DRd, DRs, #width, #lsb
```

Extracts a bitfield from DRs. Width and LSB position are encoded in the immediate field.

### BFINS (opcode 13)

```
BFINS DRd, DRs, #width, #lsb
```

Inserts a bitfield from DRs into DRd at the specified position.

### MCMP (opcode 14)

```
MCMP DRd, DRs
```

Compares DRd and DRs, setting condition flags (N, Z, C, V) without storing a result. Used before conditional instructions.

### IADD (opcode 15)

```
IADD DRd, DRs, #imm
```

Integer addition. DRd = DRs + imm. Sets condition flags.

### ISUB (opcode 16)

```
ISUB DRd, DRs, #imm
```

Integer subtraction. DRd = DRs - imm. Sets condition flags.

### BRANCH (opcode 17)

```
BRANCH #offset
BRANCHEQ #offset
BRANCHNE #offset
```

Branches to PC + offset (signed). Always conditional-compatible. Offset is relative to the current instruction.

### SHL (opcode 18)

```
SHL DRd, DRs, #amount
```

Logical shift left. DRd = DRs << amount.

### SHR (opcode 19)

```
SHR DRd, DRs, #amount
```

Logical shift right. DRd = DRs >> amount.
