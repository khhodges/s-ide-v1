- **Social/Internet** (Layers 5–7): ~150–250 lines per abstraction (mostly routing/delegation)
- **Tests**: ~100–200 lines per abstraction

**Total estimated codebase**: ~50–70K lines of code across hardware + software.

- ZLIB + ZIP handling
- Resend email/SMS API (for Home Base tunnel)
- pytest for integration tests

### Team Capacity
- **2 engineers full-time** (18–24 weeks)
- OR **3–4 engineers part-time** (12–16 weeks)
- OR **1 engineer full-time** (36–48 weeks, not recommended)

## Risk Mitigation

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-------------|--------|-----------|
| Abstract GT hardware validation delays | Medium | High | Start Phase 0 immediately; use simulation if needed |
| Network transport (Resend) integration complexity | Medium | High | Prototype Home Base messaging in isolation first |
| MTBF counter rollover/edge cases | Low | Medium | Extensive counter behavior tests before Phase 3 |
| GC wraparound edge cases (gt_seq overflow) | Low | Medium | Formal verification of GC state machine |
| Trigonometric precision issues (SlideRule) | Low | Medium | Use CORDIC library; validate against reference implementations |
| Multi-threaded race conditions | Medium | High | Use thread sanitizer; extensive stress tests in Phase 2 |

---

## Success Criteria

**Phase 0**: ✅ Abstract GTs validated by hardware, Navana writes NS entries, peripherals probed at boot  
**Phase 1**: ✅ UART send/receive, LED patterns, Button events, Timer interrupts, Display output  
**Phase 2**: ✅ Multi-threaded programs run; lazy loading; synchronization primitives work  
**Phase 3**: ✅ CTMMs reach IDE; MTBF gating abstractions; telemetry flowing  
**Phase 4**: ✅ Church numerals compute correctly (SUCC/PRED/ADD verified)  
**Phase 5**: ✅ Trigonometry matches reference (HP-35 comparison); geometric calculations correct  
**Phase 6**: ✅ Family isolation enforced; Schoolroom lessons delivered; Tunnel messaging works  
**Phase 7**: ✅ Browser navigates (simulated); Messenger sends/receives; Email routable  
**Phase 8**: ✅ GC reclaims stale entries; no stale GTs used  
**Phase 9**: ✅ Full integration: 45 abstractions callable in any combination; 9 layers hierarchical; all 14 DoS prevention claims validated; security audit passing  

---

## Conclusion

The Church Machine's 45 abstractions across 9 layers represent a **complete, self-contained operating system** with no external kernel dependencies. Implementation in 18–24 weeks (dual-team) is feasible and realistic, with **Phase 0 (Abstract GT validation) as the immediate blocker**. Once that unblocks, Phases 1–3 can proceed in parallel with later layers, achieving a fully functional, security-hardened, capability-based architecture by week 24.

The abstraction model is **scale-free** — the same pattern (CALL, c-list isolation, MTBF tracking, GT revocation) applies from a boot driver to a global social network. This uniformity means much of the code is templatable, reducing actual implementation time below the linear estimate.
