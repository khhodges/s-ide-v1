# Church Machine Architecture

## Overview

The Church Machine is a capability-secured processor that enforces security at the instruction level. There is no operating system, no privileged mode, no superuser. Every memory access — read or write — passes through a hardware validation gate (mLoad or mSave) that checks an unforgeable Golden Token before permitting the operation.

## Design Principles

### No Ambient Authority

Traditional systems grant programs implicit access to resources. The Church Machine requires explicit capability tokens for every operation. A program can only access what it holds tokens for.

### Domain Purity

The instruction set is split into two domains:

- **Church domain** (10 instructions): Capability manipulation — LOAD, SAVE, CALL, RETURN, CHANGE, SWITCH, TPERM, LAMBDA, ELOADCALL, XLOADLAMBDA
- **Turing domain** (10 instructions + shared RETURN): Data processing — DREAD, DWRITE, BFEXT, BFINS, MCMP, IADD, ISUB, BRANCH, SHL, SHR

A code object (CLOOMC) belongs to the DATA domain — it is data stored in memory, accessed via X permission. Code is never a Church-domain entity. The Church domain handles capabilities (GTs, c-lists); the Turing domain handles computation. A code object may contain Church instructions or Turing instructions, but the object itself is always data. This separation is enforced in hardware.

### Abstractions as Security Blocks

An abstraction is a security block — a protected unit of functionality with measurable reliability. Each abstraction has:

- A c-list (CR6 target) containing its capabilities
- Code (CR7 target at c-list[0]) — a DATA-domain object implementing its methods
- Entry via CALL (E-GT); LAMBDA (X-GT) is a method within abstractions, not a separate security block
- MTBF (Mean Time Between Failures) measured by fault reports over time in the namespace

Abstractions are not OS calls — they are namespace entries accessed via Golden Tokens. Every fault against an abstraction is counted and tracked. The abstraction's MTBF is the ratio of uptime to fault count, providing a continuous reliability measure for each security block in the namespace.

### Polymorphic Abstraction Interface

Every abstraction — regardless of type or layer — shares the same four structural operations: create, destroy, call, inspect. This uniformity is intentional. The polymorphic interface ensures that creating a math library works the same as creating a hardware driver or a social networking tool. The pattern is repetitive by design.

### Hardware Device Access (L/S Domain)

All hardware devices (UART, LED, Button, Timer, Display) are accessed through Church domain permissions (L/S/E) — NOT Turing domain (R/W). This enforces capability-gated device access:

- **L (Load)**: Read data from device (receive bytes, read button state, read timer)
- **S (Save)**: Write data to device (send bytes, set LEDs, start timer, write display)
- **E (Enter)**: Call the device abstraction via CALL instruction

R, W, and X permissions are NOT permitted on hardware devices.

## Golden Token Format

```
31        25 24          8 7      2 1  0
| Version  |    Index    | Perms  |Type|
|  7 bits  |   17 bits   | 6 bits |2 b |
```

### Version (7 bits)

Monotonically increasing counter. Must match the version stored in the namespace entry. On mismatch, the GT is dead — access FAULTs. Revocation is instant: increment the namespace version, and every copy of every GT referencing that entry dies on next use.

### Index (17 bits)

Points to a namespace entry. Supports up to 131,072 entries.

### Permissions (6 bits)

| Bit | Name | Gate | Domain |
|-----|------|------|--------|
| 0 | R | DREAD | Turing |
| 1 | W | DWRITE | Turing |
| 2 | X | LAMBDA | Church |
| 3 | L | LOAD | Church |
| 4 | S | SAVE | Church |
| 5 | E | CALL | Church |

R, W are data permissions (Turing domain access). X, L, S, E are capability permissions (Church domain access).

### Type (2 bits)

| Value | Type | Meaning |
|-------|------|---------|
| 00 | Inform | Inbound capability reference |
| 01 | Outform | Outbound/remote capability (F-bit networking) |
| 10 | NULL | Empty slot — access FAULTs |
| 11 | Abstract | Standard local capability |

## Register Architecture

### Context Registers (CR0–CR15)

128-bit registers holding Golden Tokens. Each CR stores four 32-bit words:

- **word0**: The GT itself (version + index + perms + type)
- **word1**: Location/base address, plus B-bit (bit 31) and F-bit (bit 30)
- **word2**: Limit/bounds
- **word3**: Seal (FNV-1a hash for integrity)

Special assignments:
- **CR6**: Current capability list (c-list) — entered via CALL
- **CR7**: Current code object (CLOOMC) — instruction fetch source
- **CR8**: Thread identity
- **CR9**: Interrupt handler
- **CR10**: Default fault handler
- **CR15**: Namespace root

### Data Registers (DR0–DR15)

32-bit integer registers. DR0 is hardwired to zero.

### Flags

ARM-style condition flags: N (negative), Z (zero), C (carry), V (overflow). Set by Turing arithmetic instructions (IADD, ISUB, MCMP). All instructions support conditional execution via 4-bit condition codes.

## Memory Architecture

### Unified Address Space

```
0x0000 – 0xFCFF    General memory (code + data objects)
0xFD00 – 0xFDFF    Namespace table (NS entries)
0xFE00 – 0xFEFF    Device I/O (UART, LED, Button, Timer, Display) — L/S access only
0xFF00 – 0xFFFF    Machine registers (read-only inspection)
```

All segments are accessed through the same GT gate via mLoad.

### Namespace Entries

Each namespace entry is 3 words (96 bits):

- **Word 0**: Location (32-bit base address of the object)
- **Word 1**: B(31) | F(30) | G(29) | ... | Limit(16:0) — flags and bounds
- **Word 2**: Version(31:25) | Seal(24:0) — 7-bit version + 25-bit FNV-1a integrity hash

Seal = FNV-1a(word0, word1[16:0]). Recomputed and verified on every mLoad access (step 3). If word0 or word1 are tampered, the seal check fails.

## Boot Sequence

The boot sequence follows a deterministic flow:

1. **FAULT_RST**: All CRs cleared to NULL, all DRs zeroed. M-Elevation ON.
2. **LOAD_NS**: CR15 initialized with GT to Namespace Root (Slot 0).
3. **INIT_THRD**: CR8 initialized with Thread Identity (Slot 1).
4. **INIT_CLIST**: CR6 loaded with Boot C-List (Slot 2).
5. **LOAD_NUC**: CR7 loaded with Boot Code (CLOOMC from Slot 3). PC = 0.
6. **COMPLETE**: M-Elevation OFF. Machine begins executing boot code.

After boot, the code CALLs Salvation (NS[4]) to verify the security pipeline. Salvation proves LOAD, TPERM, and LAMBDA work correctly, then transitions to Navana (NS[5]). Navana does not RETURN — it becomes the permanent namespace controller, managing all abstractions, intrusion detection (IDS), and system lifecycle indefinitely.

## Security Pipeline (mLoad)

Every read-side memory access passes through this 7-step pipeline:

1. **GT Type Check** — NULL type → FAULT
2. **Version Match** — GT version must equal NS entry version
3. **Seal Verify** — FNV-1a hash must match NS entry seal
4. **Bounds Check** — Access address must be within [location, location + limit)
5. **Permission Check** — Required permission bit must be set in GT
6. **F-bit Check** — F=1 means far/foreign object (requires tunnel)
7. **Data Delivery** — Access permitted, data returned

mSave (write gate) performs the symmetric check for c-list writes, additionally requiring B=1 (bindable) on the source GT.

## B-bit (Bind)

Namespace entry word1, bit 31. Controls whether a GT can be saved into another c-list:

- B=0 (default): GT cannot be copied to other c-lists — mSave FAULTs
- B=1: GT is bindable — mSave permits the write

CALL automatically clears B on all preserved CRs passed to the callee ("no bind by default"). Explicit TPERM with B modifier enables binding.

## Instruction Fetch

Instruction fetch uses CR7 (CLOOMC):

- PC is an offset within the current code object, not an absolute address
- Bounds checked against CR7's limit
- CALL sets PC=0 and CR7 to callee's CLOOMC
- RETURN restores saved CR7 and PC

## CALL / RETURN

CALL performs:
1. Validate E permission on target GT
2. Load target's c-list into CR6
3. Load target's code (c-list[0]) into CR7
4. Save caller's CR6, CR7, PC to call stack
5. Clear B-bit on preserved CRs
6. Set PC = 0

RETURN restores:
1. Pop saved CR6, CR7, PC from call stack
2. Resume at saved PC

## LAMBDA

Lightweight in-scope code application:
1. Validate X permission on target GT
2. Save current PC as lambda return point
3. Execute target code in current scope (no c-list switch)
4. Machine-status fast path: if target code is a single instruction, execute inline

## Garbage Collection (PP250)

Deterministic four-phase garbage collection:

1. **Scan** — Walk namespace entries, mark reachable via G-bit
2. **Identify** — Find unreachable entries (G-bit not set)
3. **Clear** — Reclaim unreachable entries
4. **Flip** — Toggle GC polarity for next cycle

PP250 excludes HALT — the machine always returns to boot sequence. Namespace and memory persist across reboots (warm reboot).

## Revocation

Revocation is instant, global, and unforgeable:

1. Increment the version on the namespace entry
2. Every outstanding GT referencing that entry now has a version mismatch
3. Next mLoad check FAULTs — no need to find or track copies
4. Re-grant by creating a new GT with the new version

## Network Transparency

Outform GTs (type=01) with F-bit=1 represent remote resources:

- Access triggers tunnel protocol (HTTPS/RPC)
- Same GT format, same permission model
- mLoad detects F-bit and routes to Tunnel abstraction
- Transparent to application code
