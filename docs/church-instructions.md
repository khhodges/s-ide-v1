# Church Instructions Reference

**CONFIDENTIAL**

## Overview

The Church instructions implement capability-based access control as hardware-enforced operations. They are the mechanism by which software interacts with Golden Tokens (GTs), capability registers (CRs), and the Namespace. Named after Alonzo Church, these instructions embody the lambda calculus principle of controlled access through abstraction.

All Church instructions that access the namespace route through the **mLoad master validation path**, which enforces permission checks, bounds validation, MAC verification, and G-bit reset on every access.

---

## Architectural Principles

1. **CR0-CR11 Only**: Church instructions can only address CR0-CR11 via the 4-bit register field. Privileged registers CR12-CR15 are physically unreachable through instruction encoding (exception: DREAD/DWRITE may use CR14 as source).
2. **SWITCH Is the Gate**: The only way to write to privileged registers CR12-CR15 is through the privileged SWITCH instruction.
3. **Permission Domains Are Mutually Exclusive**: Turing (R, W, X) and Church (L, S, E) permissions cannot be mixed within a single operation context.
4. **Failsafe FAULT**: Every validation failure (permission, bounds, version, MAC) routes to a FAULT handler — except TPERM, which sets Z=0 on failure to enable conditional execution without trapping.
5. **C-List Mediation**: LOAD and SAVE operate through capability-mediated access, never through raw memory addressing.
6. **mLoad Validation**: All namespace access routes through the mLoad trusted path, which always resets the G-bit on accessed entries.
7. **G-bit Reset on Access**: Every namespace access resets G=0 on the accessed entry, regardless of the instruction or permission type. Reachability determines liveness.

## The Ten Church Instructions

### 1. LOAD — Load Capability from C-List

**Purpose**: Retrieve a Golden Token from a C-List entry and place it into a capability register.

**Required Permission**: L (Load) on the C-List capability

**Validation Path**: Routes through mLoad — permission check, bounds check, GT fetch, namespace validation, MAC check, G-bit reset, thread update.

**Operation**:
1. Check that the C-List capability has L permission via mLoad → FAULT if not
2. Use the index operand to locate the entry
3. Validate bounds (index must be within valid range) → FAULT if not
4. Validate GT against namespace (version, MAC/seal) → FAULT if invalid
5. Reset G=0 on the accessed namespace entry
6. Copy the capability into the destination CR

**Mnemonic**: `LOAD CRd, CRs, index`

| Aspect | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| **Permission Check** | L on source CR (M-elevation by microcode for CR6) |
| **GT Validation** | Version match + MAC seal validation |
| **G-bit Reset** | Yes — G bit cleared on namespace access via mLoad |
| **Bounds Check** | Index must be within C-List bounds |
| **Result** | Validated GT loaded into destination CR |

---

### 2. SAVE — Save Capability to C-List

**Purpose**: Store a Golden Token from a capability register into a C-List or namespace entry.

**Required Permission**: S (Save) on the C-List capability

**Validation Path**: Routes through mSave for write validation; G-bit reset on the accessed C-List namespace entry.

**Operation**:
1. Check that the C-List capability has S permission → FAULT if not
2. Use the index operand to locate the target entry
3. Validate bounds → FAULT if not
4. Copy the capability from the source CR into the target entry
5. Reset G=0 on the accessed C-List namespace entry

**Mnemonic**: `SAVE CRd, CRs, index` — CRd is the destination c-list (requires S permission), CRs is the source GT (requires B=1)

| Aspect | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| **Permission Check** | S on CRd (destination c-list); B=1 on CRs (source GT) |
| **Bounds Check** | Index must be within C-List bounds |
| **Seal Recompute** | MAC seal recomputed from Location+Limit |
| **G-bit Reset** | Yes — on accessed C-List namespace entry |
| **Result** | Capability stored into target C-List entry |

---

### 3. CALL — Protected Call Through Capability

**Purpose**: Invoke a protected abstraction (service/function) referenced by a Golden Token, saving context for later return. The `imm15` field carries the **method index** for hardware method-table dispatch.

**Validation Path**: Routes through mLoad for loading the callee's context — permission check, namespace validation, MAC check, G-bit reset.

**Operation**:
1. Check E permission on the target CR via mLoad → FAULT if not
2. Validate the GT → FAULT if invalid
3. Reset G=0 on the callee's namespace entry
4. FAULT if call stack full (256 frames)
5. Push 2-word frame: [caller's E-GT | NIA+machine_indicators]
6. Set CR6 = callee c-list (E-only), CR14 = callee code (RX, privileged)
7. Hardware method-table dispatch: if imm15 = 0 → NIA = lump_base + 4 (word 1); if imm15 = n > 0 → read memory[lump_base + n×4]; zero entry → PRIVATE_METHOD FAULT; else NIA = lump_base + entry×4

**Mnemonic**: `CALL CRs [, #index]`

| Aspect | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| **Required Permission** | E (Enter) on source CR |
| **GT Validation** | Version match + MAC seal validation |
| **G-bit Reset** | Yes — on callee namespace entry via mLoad |
| **Frame Pushed** | 2 words: [caller E-GT \| NIA+machine_indicators] — no CRs or DRs saved |
| **Stack Overflow** | FAULT if stack full (256 frames). stackSpace indicator updated |
| **Method index = 0** | NIA = lump_base + 4 (word 1, single entry point, backward-compatible) |
| **Method index n > 0** | NIA = memory[lump_base + n×4]; zero entry → PRIVATE_METHOD FAULT |
| **PC = 0** | Always FAULTs — lump header (word 0) is never a valid entry point |
| **New Context** | CR6 = callee c-list (E-only), CR14 = callee code (RX, privileged) |
| **Unchanged** | DR0–DR15, CR0–CR5, CR7–CR13, CR15 — callee inherits all from caller |

---

### 4. RETURN — Return from Protected Call

**Purpose**: Restore context saved by a previous CALL and resume execution at the caller.

**Required Permission**: None (return is always permitted if a saved context exists)

**Frame structure**: CALL pushes 2 words. RETURN pops them. The caller's E-GT in Word 0 is revalidated by mLoad — this catches use-after-free (version mismatch → FAULT) and resets the G-bit for GC liveness tracking.

**Operation**:
1. Check that a frame exists on the call stack → FAULT if empty
2. Pop Word 0 (caller's E-GT) and Word 1 (NIA | machine indicators)
3. mLoad the caller's E-GT: version check + MAC + G-bit reset → FAULT on failure
4. Re-run NS split on caller's NS entry → re-derive CR6 (caller c-list) and CR14 (caller code)
5. Restore PC from NIA (Word 1); restore machine indicators from Word 1
6. Apply mask[11:0]: all CRs with mask bit set written to NULL in one parallel clock edge

**Mnemonic**: `RETURN [mask]` — mask is a 12-bit literal in instruction bits [11:0]; mask=0 is the no-op default (`RETURN` with no argument)

| Aspect | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| **Permission Check** | None |
| **E-GT Revalidation** | mLoad on caller's E-GT: version, MAC, G-bit reset (FAULT on failure) |
| **CR6 / CR14 Restore** | Re-derived from caller's NS entry via NS split — not stored directly in frame |
| **CR5** | Thread register — installed by CHANGE from Zone ④ bounds; not touched by CALL/RETURN |
| **PC Restore** | NIA from Word 1 |
| **Machine Indicators** | Restored from Word 1 (LAMBDA-active, flags, stackSpace, etc.) |
| **Mask** | bits [11:0] — **not implemented in current hardware**; all bits ignored. Bit 6 reserved (must be 0 — CR6 always re-derived from E-GT). Assembler warns if any bit is set. Use bare `RETURN` (mask=0). |
| **Unchanged** | DR0–DR15 and non-masked CRs retain callee values |
| **Stack Underflow** | FAULT: no saved context |
| **Stack Indicators** | stackFrames and stackSpace updated |

**Mask field status**: The mask field is reserved for future implementation. It is not enforced by current hardware — encoding a non-zero mask produces an assembler warning but the clearing does not occur. Always use bare `RETURN` (mask=0) in current programs.

---

### 5. CHANGE — Change Thread Context

**Purpose**: Suspend the current thread and activate another — full atomic context swap. CHANGE indexes a Thread Abstraction GT from a C-List and performs the complete per-thread state exchange.

**Validation Path**: Indexes CRd at offset idx; verifies E permission on the Thread Abstraction GT.

**Operation**:
1. Index CRd at offset idx; verify the GT has E permission — FAULT on fail
2. Suspend outgoing thread: save per-thread state (DR0–DR15, CR0–CR11, STO, PC, FLAGS) into its thread lump; CR13, CR14, CR15 are never touched
3. Activate incoming thread: restore per-thread state from its thread lump
4. The suspended thread resumes exactly where it left off

**Mnemonic**: `CHANGE CRd, idx`

| Aspect | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| **Permission Check** | E (Enter) on Thread Abstraction GT at CRd[idx] |
| **Per-Thread Saved/Restored** | DR0–DR15, CR0–CR11, CR14 (code register), CR15 (namespace root), STO, PC, FLAGS |
| **System-Wide Unchanged** | CR12 (thread stack), CR13 (IRQ handler) |
| **G-bit Reset** | Yes — on accessed namespace entries |

---

### 6. SWITCH — Install PassKey into System Register

**Purpose**: Write a PassKey capability into system register CR13 (IRQ Thread) or CR15 (Namespace root). This is the only instruction that can modify these system-wide registers, making it the privilege gate for namespace and interrupt management. CR12 (thread stack) and CR14 (transient code-view) cannot be SWITCH targets.

**Validation Path**: Two mandatory hardware checks before the write; namespace access via mLoad with G-bit reset.

**Operation**:
1. Decode the 3-bit `Tgt` field; FAULT if Tgt is not CR13 (101₂) or CR15 (111₂)
2. Check source register is CR0–CR11 (4-bit encoding); FAULT if out of range
3. **PassKey type check** — CRs.word0_gt.gt_type must equal `11₂` (Abstract GT); FAULT if not
4. **Sentinel address check** — CRs.word1_location must equal the reserved hardware sentinel for the chosen target; FAULT on mismatch:
   - Tgt = CR13: sentinel = `0xFFFFFFFE` (all-1s − 1)
   - Tgt = CR15: sentinel = `0xFFFFFFFF` (all-1s)
5. Install CRs into the target system register via mLoad; reset G=0 on accessed namespace entries

**Mnemonic**: `SWITCH CRs, target`

| Aspect | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| **Valid Targets** | CR13 (Tgt=101₂, IRQ Thread), CR15 (Tgt=111₂, Namespace) — all others FAULT |
| **PassKey type** | CRs.word0_gt.gt_type must be Abstract (11₂); any other type → FAULT |
| **Sentinel for CR13** | CRs.word1_location == `0xFFFFFFFE` (all-1s − 1) |
| **Sentinel for CR15** | CRs.word1_location == `0xFFFFFFFF` (all-1s) |
| **Sentinel mismatch** | CRs sentinel does not match chosen target → FAULT |
| **G-bit Reset** | Yes — via mLoad on namespace access |
| **Not writable by SWITCH** | CR12 (thread stack, system-wide), CR14 (transient cLoad output) |

---

## TPERM — Test Permission / GT Health Check

TPERM is the single-instruction GT health check. It evaluates permissions, validity, and bounds in one cycle and **sets condition flags** — it does not trap. The flags persist across subsequent instructions, enabling ARM-style conditional execution for zero-cost try-catch patterns.

```
TPERM CRs, #preset [, offset]
```

**What TPERM checks (all at once)**:
1. **Permissions** — does the GT have the requested permission bits? (R, W, RW, E, LS, etc.)
2. **Valid** — does the GT pass version and MAC validation?
3. **Base + Limit** — if an offset is provided, is Base + offset within the GT's region?

**Flags set**:
- **Z = 1**: all checks passed (permissions present, valid, in bounds)
- **Z = 0**: one or more checks failed

**Faulting**: TPERM faults with `TPERM_RSV` if the preset code is reserved (codes 10–12 and 15, and their B-modifier variants 0x1A–0x1C and 0x1F). Codes 13 (FRAME) and 14 (EXACT) are valid non-permission presets and never fault. For all valid presets, TPERM does not fault — if a permission check fails the Z flag says so and software decides what to do via conditional execution. The actual LOAD/SAVE/CALL instructions that follow enforce safety. TPERM is the "ask first" instruction.

**B-modifier hardware gap**: The B-modifier (bit 4 of the 5-bit preset field) is recognised by the assembler and simulator — it clears the GT B-bit (Busy bit, word0[31]) in the cached CR when the permission test passes. However, the hardware decoder (`ctmm_cap_amaranth/decoder.py`, `hardware/decoder.py`) currently reads only the lower 4 bits of the preset field (`instr[20:24]`); bit 4 is not yet decoded on real silicon. The B-modifier therefore operates in software only until the hardware field is widened from 4 bits to 5 bits in a future release.

No namespace access occurs — TPERM is a register-local read-only operation. No G-bit reset.

### Conditional Execution: Zero-Cost Try-Catch

Because every Church Machine instruction carries a 4-bit ARM condition code, TPERM + conditional suffixes give you try-catch with no branches and no overhead on the happy path:

```
TPERM CR5, RW, offset      ; check R+W perms, valid, base+offset in bounds
                            ; Z=1 if all pass, Z=0 if any fail

readEQ DR1, CR5, offset     ; happy path — only fires if Z=1
IADDEQ DR2, DR1, 1          ; happy path — continues if Z=1
writeEQ CR5, offset, DR2    ; happy path — writes if Z=1

; catch path (TBD — recovery is case-by-case)
; instructions with NE suffix fire when Z=0
```

The happy path does not branch, does not check errors, does not even know failure is possible. Every instruction carries EQ and the hardware silently skips it if TPERM failed.

### Permission Restriction (monotonic)

TPERM can also restrict permissions on a GT:

```
TPERM CRd, #preset
```

The assembler encodes restriction mode by setting `imm15 = 0x7FFF` (all fifteen bits set). This sentinel distinguishes restriction from a health-check at offset 0 (`imm15 = 0`), which is a valid bounds test of the base address itself. The full range 0–32766 is available for health-check offsets.

Permissions can only be removed, never added (monotonic restriction). Domain purity is enforced: Turing (R, W, X) and Church (L, S, E) permissions cannot be mixed.

### Full Metadata Query

TPERM can read all metadata fields from a CR into a data register:

**Result Layout (DRd)**:
| Bits | Field | Description |
|------|-------|-------------|
| [5:0] | Permissions | R, W, X, L, S, E from CRs Golden Token |
| [10:6] | (Reserved) | Zero |
| [11] | stackFrames | 1 = at least one frame on call stack (RETURN safe) |
| [12] | stackSpace | 1 = room for at least one more frame (CALL safe) |
| [13] | Valid | 1 = GT passes version and MAC validation |
| [15:14] | Type | GT type: 00=NULL, 01=Inform, 10=Outform, 11=Abstract |
| [31:16] | (Reserved) | Zero |

## Fused Church Instructions

### 7. LAMBDA — In-Scope Code Application

Applies the code object referenced by a CR in the current scope. Requires X permission. Does not switch c-lists. See `docs/lambda-instruction.md` for full specification.

### 8. ELOADCALL — Fused Load + Call

Loads a GT from a c-list row (word offset) and immediately enters it. Atomic: no intermediate CR state is visible. imm15 is split: bits[7:0] = c-list row (0–255), bits[14:8] = method index for the CALL phase (0–127). Equivalent to `LOAD CRd, CRsrc, #row` followed by `CALL CRd, #method_index`, but atomic.

### 9. XLOADLAMBDA — Fused Load + Lambda

Loads a GT from a c-list row (word offset) and immediately applies it. Equivalent to `LOAD CRd, CRsrc, #row` followed by `LAMBDA CRd`, but atomic.

## Encoding

### Instruction Encoding Format
```
31    27 26  23 22  19 18  15 14           0
|opcode | cond |  dst |  src |    imm15    |
| 5 bit | 4 bit| 4 bit| 4 bit|   15 bits   |
```
Every instruction can be conditionally executed based on the condition flags. This is what enables the TPERM try-catch pattern — one TPERM sets the flags, subsequent instructions carry EQ/NE suffixes.

---

## Security Model Summary

The Church Machine enforces these core security invariants:

| Principle | Enforcement |
|-----------|-------------|
| No direct privileged register access | CR0-CR11 only in instruction encoding (4-bit field) |
| Privilege through SWITCH only | Only SWITCH writes to CR12-CR15 |
| Permission before access | Every Church instruction checks permissions before operating |
| Single validation path | All namespace access routes through mLoad |
| G-bit reset on every access | mLoad always resets G=0, ensuring GC accuracy |
| Failure handling | All violations route to FAULT handler |
| Capability-mediated access | LOAD/SAVE go through C-List capabilities, never raw memory |
| Mutually exclusive domains | Turing (R,W,X) / Church (L,S,E) |
