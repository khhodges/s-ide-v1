# Golden Tokens

**v2.0 — 2026-06-25**
**CONFIDENTIAL**

## What Are Golden Tokens?

Golden Tokens (GTs) are the fundamental unit of access control in the Church Machine architecture. Every access to a resource -- whether loading data, calling a service, or switching privilege levels -- requires a valid Golden Token that grants the necessary permissions. Golden Tokens are unforgeable: they cannot be fabricated by software, only created and managed through hardware-enforced mechanisms.

A Golden Token encodes three things:
1. **What** resource it refers to (via `slot_id` — the namespace slot ID)
2. **What operations** are permitted (via permission bits)
3. **Whether it is authentic** (via integrity32 parallel check on the NS entry)

Without a valid Golden Token, no operation proceeds. Any attempt to use an invalid, expired, or insufficient token results in a FAULT.

---

## GT Format

The Church Machine uses a 32-bit Golden Token with a precisely defined bit layout:

```
31  30 28 27  26  25 24       16 15           0
┌────┬─────┬────┬──────────┬───────────┬─────────────┐
│ b  │perm │dom │ gt_type  │  gt_seq   │   slot_id   │
│[1] │[3]  │[1] │   [2]    │   [9]     │    [16]     │
└────┴─────┴────┴──────────┴───────────┴─────────────┘
```

| Bits    | Field     | Width | Description |
|---------|-----------|-------|-------------|
| [15:0]  | `slot_id` | 16 | Namespace slot ID (0–65,535) |
| [24:16] | `gt_seq`  | 9  | Revocation sequence counter (0–511); must match NS SLOT Word 1 `gt_seq` |
| [26:25] | `gt_type` | 2  | GT class (NULL / Inform / Outform / Abstract) |
| [27]    | `dom`     | 1  | Domain: 0 = Turing {X, W, R}, 1 = Church {E, S, L} |
| [30:28] | `perm`    | 3  | Permission payload (dom=0: perm[2]=X, perm[1]=W, perm[0]=R; dom=1: perm[2]=E, perm[1]=S, perm[0]=L) |
| [31]    | `b_flag`  | 1  | Bind flag — 1 = GT may be propagated via mSave |

Each capability register in Church Machine is **96 bits wide (3 × 32-bit words)**:

| Word  | Content |
|-------|---------|
| word0 | The 32-bit Golden Token (GT_LAYOUT) |
| word1 | Lump base address (from NS SLOT Word 0) |
| word2 | NS SLOT Word 1 (WORD2_LAYOUT): `f_flag[31] \| g_bit[30] \| gt_seq[29:21] \| limit_offset[20:0]` |

integrity32 is verified during LOAD but is **not stored** in the capability register.

## GT Permission Bits (Church Machine)

The GT encodes permissions using a **1-bit domain selector (`dom`) and a 3-bit permission payload (`perm[2:0]`)** at bits [30:27]. Turing and Church permissions are mutually exclusive by construction — the `dom` bit selects which set the 3-bit payload refers to:

```
Encoding:  dom=0 (Turing): perm[2]=X, perm[1]=W, perm[0]=R
           dom=1 (Church):  perm[2]=E, perm[1]=S, perm[0]=L
```

| perm bit | dom=0 (Turing) | dom=1 (Church) | Description |
|----------|---------------|----------------|-------------|
| perm[0]  | R | L | Turing: Read data. Church: Load a GT from C-List via mLoad |
| perm[1]  | W | S | Turing: Write data. Church: Save a GT to C-List via mSave |
| perm[2]  | X | E | Turing: Execute code. Church: Enter an abstraction |

### Domain Purity

A GT carries **either** Turing permissions (R, W, X) **or** Church permissions (L, S, E) — never both. Domain purity is **structurally enforced by the encoding**: the `dom` bit selects which interpretation applies, making a mixed-domain GT impossible to represent. The encoder clamps to Church (dom=1) when any Church bit (L, S, E) is present.

### E Isolation

Within the Church domain, E (Enter — invoke an abstraction) must be **standalone**. E may not be combined with L (Load from c-list) or S (Save to c-list). A token that combines E with L or S would allow its holder to both traverse the nodal c-list and enter the abstraction it contains — an attack path that bypasses the separation between the capability list and the code it holds. E is the entry key to a function; L and S are the keys to the capability list that owns it. They must never be the same key.

```
Valid:   R, W, X, RW, RX, RWX             (Turing pure)
Valid:   L, S, E, LS                       (Church pure — E standalone)
Invalid: RL, WL, XE, RE, WS, RWXE, RWXL  (cross-domain — any mix of {R,W,X} with {L,S,E})
Invalid: LE, SE, LSE                       (E isolation — E combined with L or S exposes abstraction internals)
```

### B Flag — Bind

`B` (bit 31 of GT Word 0) controls whether the GT may be propagated to another c-list via mSave:

- **B=0** (default): the GT cannot be copied out of its current c-list — mSave FAULTs.
- **B=1**: the GT is bindable — mSave permits the write.

B is set by the IDE at lump creation time and may be cleared by CALL on preserved CRs passed to the callee ("no bind by default").

### M Permission -- Transient Microcode Elevation

M is **not stored in the GT**. It exists only as a transient signal (`sub_m_elevated`) that microcode asserts during mLoad execution. When mLoad completes, M is gone. No user instruction can set, test, or observe M. This prevents privilege escalation.

## GT Type Field (`gt_type`, bits [26:25])

The Church Machine includes a 2-bit type field classifying the nature of the referenced resource:

| Value | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| 00 | NULL | Empty / invalid — always faults on use |
| 01 | Inform | GT points to a lump or data object in local memory via an NS SLOT |
| 10 | Outform | GT references an IDE-managed dependency (lazy-loaded via Locator). Whether the resolving IDE node is local or far is determined by `f_flag` in the NS SLOT Word 1, not by the GT word itself. |
| 11 | Abstract | GT IS the value — constants, immutable credentials, PassKey tokens |

NULL is architecturally distinct from all valid reference types. Any GT with `gt_type=00` immediately faults at ChurchNSGate before any NS lookup is performed.

---

## gt_seq Field (bits [24:16])

Church Machine includes a 9-bit `gt_seq` field in bits [24:16] of the Golden Token. This revocation counter is critical for namespace integrity and garbage collection safety:

- Each NS SLOT stores a corresponding `gt_seq` value in SLOT Word 1 bits [29:21].
- When a GT is used (LOAD or CALL), ChurchNSGate compares `gt_word0.gt_seq` against the NS SLOT's `gt_seq`. A mismatch means the GT has been revoked — access FAULTs immediately.
- During garbage collection, reclaimed entries have their `gt_seq` incremented. All outstanding GTs referencing that entry become stale instantly.
- 9 bits gives 512 revocation generations before wraparound.

---

## Namespace Entry Format (NS SLOT)

Each namespace entry (NS SLOT) occupies **4 consecutive 32-bit words** (16 bytes). The slot byte address is `slot_id × 16` from the NS table base. The NS table supports up to **65,536 entries** (bounded by the 16-bit `slot_id` field).

### Word 0 — lump_base

The 32-bit lump base byte address in DMEM.

### Word 1 — authority (WORD2_LAYOUT)

```
31       30      29       21 20                  0
┌────────┬───────┬──────────┬────────────────────┐
│f_flag  │ g_bit │  gt_seq  │   limit_offset     │
│  [1]   │  [1]  │  [9]     │     [20:0]         │
└────────┴───────┴──────────┴────────────────────┘
```

| Bits    | Field          | Description |
|---------|---------------|-------------|
| [20:0]  | `limit_offset` | Object size in words minus 1 (21-bit) |
| [29:21] | `gt_seq`       | 9-bit revocation counter; compared against GT `gt_seq` by ChurchNSGate |
| [30]    | `g_bit`        | GC mark bit — may be set by GC; masked to 0 before integrity32 check |
| [31]    | `f_flag`       | Far indicator — 0 = local node; 1 = remote IDE node resolves this SLOT. This is a **SLOT property**, not stored in the GT word. Both `g_bit` and `f_flag` are masked to 0 before integrity32 is computed. |

### Word 2 — integrity32 Check

The 32-bit integrity32 parallel check result, computed over NS SLOT Word 0 and Word 1 (with both `g_bit[30]` and `f_flag[31]` masked to zero before the check).

### Word 3 — abstract_gt (advisory)

An optional GT annotation used by the IDE namespace viewer. Not covered by integrity32. Used by the hardware only when the M-bit elevation path is active.

### integrity32 Integrity

ChurchNSGate recomputes integrity32 over NS SLOT Word 0 and Word 1 (`g_bit` and `f_flag` both cleared) and compares against NS SLOT Word 2. A mismatch faults with `SEAL` error, preventing use of any tampered NS SLOT.

## Capability Registers (CAP_REG)

Each capability register (CAP_REG) is **96 bits wide (3 × 32-bit words)**. The programmer cannot read the internal words directly — they interact with CRs only through LOAD, SAVE, CALL, RETURN, CHANGE, SWITCH, TPERM, LAMBDA, ELOADCALL, and XLOADLAMBDA. integrity32 is verified by LOAD (ChurchNSGate pipeline) but is **not stored** in the register.

The Church Machine provides 16 capability registers (CR0–CR15), divided into two groups:

### Instruction-Addressable Registers (CR0–CR11)

These registers are directly accessible by Church instructions through a 4-bit register encoding field. Software can freely read and manipulate GTs in these registers using LOAD, SAVE, and other Church instructions.

### Privileged Registers (CR12–CR15)

These registers are protected from direct instruction access. The only way to write to a privileged register is through the SWITCH instruction, which requires appropriate permissions. This architectural constraint prevents privilege escalation through direct register manipulation.

### Special Register Roles

| Register | Name | Role |
|----------|------|------|
| **CR6**  | C-List | Current capability list — the set of capabilities available to running code |
| **CR12** | Thread Stack | Thread stack capability (privileged, system-wide; loaded at boot B:02) |
| **CR13** | Interrupt | System-wide interrupt handler capability (privileged, unchanged by CHANGE) |
| **CR14** | Code/[CLOOMC](https://sipantic.blogspot.com/2025/03/xx.html) | Current code GT — instruction fetch source (privileged, per-thread; re-derived by CALL) |
| **CR15** | Namespace | Namespace root — defines the security boundary of the entire system |

CR6 and CR14 are re-derived by CALL/RETURN via mLoad. CR12 is saved and restored by CHANGE (thread switching). CR13 and CR15 are system-wide and unchanged by CHANGE. The privileged zone (CR12–CR15) cannot be addressed by normal programmer instructions.
