# Golden Tokens

## What Are Golden Tokens?

Golden Tokens (GTs) are the fundamental unit of access control in the Church Machine architecture. Every access to a resource -- whether loading data, calling a service, or switching privilege levels -- requires a valid Golden Token that grants the necessary permissions. Golden Tokens are unforgeable: they cannot be fabricated by software, only created and managed through hardware-enforced mechanisms.

A Golden Token encodes three things:
1. **What** resource it refers to (via `object_id` — the namespace slot index)
2. **What operations** are permitted (via permission bits)
3. **Whether it is authentic** (via CRC-16/CCITT integrity check on the NS entry)

Without a valid Golden Token, no operation proceeds. Any attempt to use an invalid, expired, or insufficient token results in a FAULT.

## GT Format

The Church Machine uses a 32-bit Golden Token with a precisely defined bit layout:

```
31      25 24  23 22      16 15           0
┌─────────┬──────┬──────────┬─────────────┐
│B R W X  │ typ  │  gt_seq  │  object_id  │
│ L S E   │ [2]  │   [7]    │    [16]     │
│  [7]    │      │          │             │
└─────────┴──────┴──────────┴─────────────┘
```

| Bits  | Field      | Width | Description |
|-------|-----------|-------|-------------|
| [15:0]  | `object_id` | 16 | Namespace slot index (0–65,535) |
| [22:16] | `gt_seq`    | 7  | Revocation sequence counter; must match NS Entry Word 1 `gt_seq` |
| [24:23] | `typ`       | 2  | GT class (NULL / Inform / Outform / Abstract) |
| [30:25] | permissions | 6  | R, W, X, L, S, E (see below) |
| [31]    | `B`         | 1  | Bind flag — 1 = GT may be propagated via mSave |

Each capability register in Church Machine is 128 bits wide (4 x 32-bit words):

| Word  | Content |
|-------|---------|
| word0 | The 32-bit Golden Token |
| word1 | Lump base address (from NS Entry Word 0) |
| word2 | NS Entry Word 1: `spare[31:28] \| gt_seq[27:21] \| limit_offset[20:0]` |
| word3 | NS Entry Word 2: `spare[31:17] \| g_bit[16] \| CRC-16[15:0]` |

## GT Permission Bits (Church Machine)

The GT stores exactly 6 permission bits in bits [30:25]. These are the mutually exclusive access rights -- three for data operations (Turing domain) and three for capability operations (Church domain):

| Bit (in perms field) | Absolute bit | Name | Domain | Description |
|-----|------|------|--------|-------------|
| 0 | 25 | R | Turing | Read data from the referenced resource |
| 1 | 26 | W | Turing | Write data to the referenced resource |
| 2 | 27 | X | Turing | Execute code at the referenced location |
| 3 | 28 | L | Church | Load a Golden Token from a C-List via mLoad |
| 4 | 29 | S | Church | Save a Golden Token to a C-List via mSave |
| 5 | 30 | E | Church | Enter an abstraction (call a service) |

### Domain Purity

A GT may carry Turing permissions (R, W, X) **or** Church permissions (L, S, E), but **never both**. This is enforced in hardware at TPERM time — any attempt to create a mixed-domain GT raises a DOMAIN_PURITY fault.

### E Isolation

Within the Church domain, E (Enter — invoke an abstraction) must be **standalone**. E may not be combined with L (Load from c-list) or S (Save to c-list). A token that combines E with L or S would allow its holder to both traverse the nodal c-list and enter the abstraction it contains — an attack path that bypasses the separation between the capability list and the code it holds. E is the entry key to a function; L and S are the keys to the capability list that owns it. They must never be the same key.

```
Valid:   R, W, X, RW, RX, RWX             (Turing pure)
Valid:   L, S, E, LS                       (Church pure — E standalone)
Invalid: RL, WL, XE, RE, WS, RWXE, RWXL  (cross-domain — any mix of {R,W,X} with {L,S,E})
Invalid: LE, SE, LSE                       (E isolation violation — E combined with L or S)
```

### B Flag — Bind

`B` (bit 31 of GT Word 0) controls whether the GT may be propagated to another c-list via mSave:

- **B=0** (default): the GT cannot be copied out of its current c-list — mSave FAULTs.
- **B=1**: the GT is bindable — mSave permits the write.

B is set by the IDE at lump creation time and may be cleared by CALL on preserved CRs passed to the callee ("no bind by default").

### M Permission -- Transient Microcode Elevation

M is **not stored in the GT**. It exists only as a transient signal (`sub_m_elevated`) that microcode asserts during mLoad execution. When mLoad completes, M is gone. No user instruction can set, test, or observe M. This prevents privilege escalation.

---

## GT Type Field (`typ`, bits [24:23])

The Church Machine includes a 2-bit type field classifying the nature of the referenced resource:

| Value | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| 00 | NULL | Empty / invalid — always faults on use |
| 01 | Inform | GT points to a lump or data object in local memory via an NS entry |
| 10 | Outform | GT references an IDE-managed dependency (lazy-loaded via Locator) |
| 11 | Abstract | GT IS the value — constants, immutable credentials, PassKey tokens |

NULL is architecturally distinct from all valid reference types. Any GT with `typ=00` immediately faults at ChurchNSGate before any NS lookup is performed.

---

## gt_seq Field (bits [22:16])

Church Machine includes a 7-bit `gt_seq` field in bits [22:16] of the Golden Token. This revocation counter is critical for namespace integrity and garbage collection safety:

- Each namespace entry stores a corresponding `gt_seq` value in NS Entry Word 1 bits [27:21].
- When a GT is used (LOAD or CALL), ChurchNSGate compares `gt_word0.gt_seq` against the NS entry's `gt_seq`. A mismatch means the GT has been revoked — access FAULTs immediately.
- During garbage collection, reclaimed entries have their `gt_seq` incremented. All outstanding GTs referencing that entry become stale instantly.
- 7 bits gives 128 revocation generations before wraparound.

---

## Namespace Entry Format

Each namespace entry occupies **3 consecutive 32-bit words** (12 bytes). The slot byte address is `object_id × 12` (or equivalently `object_id × 3` words) from the NS table base. The NS table supports up to **65,536 entries** (bounded by the 16-bit `object_id` field).

### Word 0 — Base Address

The 32-bit lump base byte address.

### Word 1 — Limit + gt_seq (WORD2_LAYOUT)

```
31      28 27      21 20                  0
┌──────────┬──────────┬────────────────────┐
│  spare   │  gt_seq  │   limit_offset     │
│  [3:0]   │  [6:0]   │     [20:0]         │
└──────────┴──────────┴────────────────────┘
```

| Bits  | Field          | Description |
|-------|---------------|-------------|
| [20:0]  | `limit_offset` | Object size in words minus 1 (21-bit) |
| [27:21] | `gt_seq`       | Revocation counter; compared against GT `gt_seq` by ChurchNSGate |
| [31:28] | spare          | Reserved |

### Word 2 — CRC + G-bit (WORD3_LAYOUT)

```
31              17 16    15              0
┌────────────────┬───┬────────────────────┐
│     spare      │ G │    CRC-16          │
│    [14:0]      │   │    [15:0]          │
└────────────────┴───┴────────────────────┘
```

| Bits  | Field   | Description |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| [15:0]  | `crc`   | CRC-16/CCITT integrity check result |
| [16]    | `g_bit` | GC mark bit — cleared on every NS access (G=0 = reachable) |
| [31:17] | spare   | Reserved |

### CRC-16/CCITT Integrity

ChurchNSGate recomputes CRC-16/CCITT (polynomial 0x1021, init 0xFFFF) over 89 bits of input:

- `gt_word0[24:0]` — 25 bits (the GT identifying the entry)
- NS Entry Word 0 (base address) — 32 bits
- NS Entry Word 1 (limit_offset + gt_seq) — 32 bits

The result is compared against NS Entry Word 2 bits [15:0]. A mismatch faults with `SEAL` error, preventing use of any tampered NS entry.

## Capability Registers

The Church Machine provides 16 capability registers (CR0–CR15), divided into two groups:

### Instruction-Addressable Registers (CR0–CR11)

These registers are directly accessible by Church instructions through a 4-bit register encoding field. Software can freely read and manipulate GTs in these registers using LOAD, SAVE, and other Church instructions.

### Privileged Registers (CR12–CR15)

These registers are protected from direct instruction access. The only way to write to a privileged register is through the SWITCH instruction, which requires appropriate permissions. This architectural constraint prevents privilege escalation through direct register manipulation.

### Special Register Roles

| Register | Name | Role |
|----------|------|------|
| **CR6**  | C-List | Current capability list — the set of capabilities available to running code |
| **CR7**  | CLOOMC | Current code object — instruction fetch source (privileged, per-thread) |
| **CR9**  | Interrupt | Interrupt handler capability |
| **CR10** | DFault | Data fault handler capability |
| **CR12** | Thread | Current thread identity |
| **CR14** | Code | Code capability for current abstraction (X-only, privileged) |
| **CR15** | Namespace | Namespace root — defines the security boundary of the entire system |

CR6 and CR14 are reloaded by CALL/RETURN via cLoad. CR12 is updated during CHANGE (thread switching). CR15 defines the namespace used for all NS lookups.
