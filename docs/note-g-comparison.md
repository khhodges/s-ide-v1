# Ada Lovelace's Note G vs. Church Computer

## Context

Ada Lovelace published Note G in August 1843 — a 25-operation program for Babbage's Analytical Engine that computed Bernoulli numbers. It is widely regarded as the first published computer algorithm. She used only four arithmetic operations (+, -, x, ÷) and variable columns (V1-V24), with each step performing one operation and tracking variable state changes.

Our `bernoulli.church` program computes the sum of squares 1² + 2² + 3² + 4² = 30 using the same step-by-step style — but on a Pure Church Lambda Machine where every operation passes through a 7-step capability-checked security pipeline. We use only six Church-domain instructions. No Turing instructions exist.

Both programs share the same philosophy: one operation per line, each result named, each step auditable.

**A note on indexing**: Ada labeled her result B₇, following a convention where B₁ was the first non-trivial Bernoulli number. In modern notation, her result corresponds to B₈ = -1/30. This document uses Ada's original labeling.

## Ada's Note G: Summary (1843)

Computing B₇ on the Analytical Engine. Reconstructed from Ada's published table in Taylor's Scientific Memoirs, August 1843. The original table uses Babbage's notation where superscript-prefixed variables (e.g., ²V₄) track the number of times each variable column has been assigned a new value.

**Structure**: 25 operations organized into four blocks:

| Block | Operations | Purpose | Runs |
|-------|-----------|---------|------|
| Initial setup | 1-7 | Compute A₀, set loop counter | Once per Bernoulli number |
| First term | 8-12 | Compute A₁ × B₁, accumulate | Once per Bernoulli number |
| Inner loop | 13-23 | Compute Aₖ × Bₖ terms, accumulate | (n-2) times |
| Finalize | 24-25 | Divide to get result, advance n | Once per Bernoulli number |

**Variables**: 13 of the Engine's variable columns are actively used:

| Variables | Role | Details |
|-----------|------|---------|
| V1, V2 | Constants | V1 = 1, V2 = 2 (never change) |
| V3 | Parameter | n (incremented at op 25 for next number) |
| V4, V5, V6 | Working | V4 = 2n-1, V5 = 2n+1, V6 decremented through loop |
| V7 | Working | Denominator factor, incremented through loop |
| V8 | Working | Ratio for coefficient update |
| V10 | Counter | Loop counter, decremented from n-1 |
| V11 | Accumulator | Builds coefficient Aₖ |
| V12 | Working | Most recent Bₖ × Aₖ product |
| V13 | Accumulator | Running sum of all terms |
| V21-V24 | Results | Previously computed Bernoulli numbers (B₁, B₃, B₅) and result B₇ |

Note: V9 is used in the inner loop (ops 17-20) as a second ratio variable. V14-V20 are skipped — the gap between working variables and result variables is deliberate, leaving room for additional Bernoulli numbers in a longer run.

**Key characteristics**:
- 25 operations using only +, -, ×, ÷
- Op 1 stores its result in three variables simultaneously (V4, V5, V6) — exploiting the Engine's ability to copy a result to multiple columns
- Operations 13-23 form a loop body with two inner sub-loops (ops 13-16 and 17-20 use the same logic with updated values)
- The loop uses a conditional backward jump: if V10 ≠ 0 after op 23, execution returns to op 13
- Superscript notation (²V₄) tracks each variable's assignment history — an innovation by Lovelace for documenting program state
- One known bug: operation 4 in the published table shows V5 ÷ V4 but should be V4 ÷ V5 (possibly a typesetting error, as the Engine was never built to test it)

**The algorithm**: Uses a recurrence relation where each new Bernoulli number is computed from all previous ones, via weighted sums with binomial-derived coefficients that are recalculated at each step.

| 15 | `let partial2 = partial1 + sq3` | Call(SlideRule.ADD, 5, 9) | 5 + 9 = 14 |
| 16 | `let verify = partial2 + sq4` | Call(SlideRule.ADD, 14, 16) | 14 + 16 = 30 |

**Totals**: 16 operations. Six Church-domain instructions only (LOAD, TPERM, CALL, LAMBDA, RETURN + method dispatch). Zero Turing instructions.

## Thematic Comparison

These are different programs solving different problems on different machines 183 years apart. The comparison is thematic — what connects them is the programming model, not the specific computation.

## What They Share

1. **One operation per line** — Each step does exactly one arithmetic/logical operation and stores the result. Ada wrote each operation on one row of her table; we write each on one line of `.church` code.

2. **Named intermediates** — Ada used V-numbered columns; we use descriptive names like `n_plus_1` and `prod1`. Both approaches make every intermediate result inspectable.

3. **Step-by-step auditability** — Ada invented a notation (superscript state tracking) specifically to document how variables change through the program. Our REPL shows the Church-domain translation alongside each result, making the security pipeline visible.

4. **No shortcuts** — Neither program uses compound expressions. Ada could not — the Analytical Engine's mill processed one operation at a time. We choose not to — each line maps to exactly one 7-step security pipeline traversal, making the capability checking auditable.

5. **Constants established first** — Ada sets V1=1, V2=2, V3=n before computing. We establish `n`, `two`, and other base values before deriving results.

6. **Mathematical proof structure** — Both programs read like mathematical derivations: establish premises, derive intermediate results, arrive at conclusion.

---

## What Differs

1. **Security model** — Ada's Analytical Engine had no access control. Every gear column was accessible to every operation. The Church Computer enforces Golden Token capability checking on every single operation — 112 security gate traversals for 16 operations.

2. **Domain purity** — Ada used Turing-domain operations (add, subtract, multiply, divide acting directly on bare numerical data). The Church Computer uses zero Turing instructions — all computation happens through Church-encoded lambda calculus, with data registers (DRn) and context registers (CRn) on physically separate hardware paths.

3. **Immutability** — Ada's variables mutate (²V₄ overwrites ¹V₄ — the same gear column holds a new value). Church Computer `let` bindings are immutable — each creates a new named value. This eliminates an entire class of state-related bugs.

4. **Loops vs. straight-line** — Ada needed loops (ops 13-23) because her algorithm computes each Bernoulli number from all previous ones, requiring iteration. Our program is a straight-line derivation — no loops, no branches, no conditional execution.

5. **Abstraction access** — Ada's operations go directly to the mill (the Engine's arithmetic unit). Our operations go through named abstractions (Lambda, SlideRule) with separate C-Lists, each requiring a Golden Token with the correct permissions.

---

## The Connection

Ada Lovelace and Charles Babbage exchanged symbolic mathematics in their correspondence. She wrote that the Analytical Engine "weaves algebraical patterns just as the Jacquard loom weaves flowers and leaves." Our symbolic math notation — `let product = n * n_plus_1` — continues that vision: a programming model that reads like mathematical correspondence, where each named step builds on the last.

The difference is that 183 years later, every one of those algebraic steps now passes through a capability-checked security pipeline. Ada's insight was that machines could compute symbolically. Ours is that symbolic computation can be made inherently secure — not by adding security on top, but by building it into the instruction set itself.

Ada's program had a bug (a division with swapped operands). In a capability-secured architecture, accessing the wrong resource would require presenting the correct Golden Token — the permission system catches classes of errors that are invisible in unprotected architectures.

## Beyond the Mechanical Age: Why Church Security Matters for Civilization

Ada Lovelace designed her program for a machine made of brass gears — the pinnacle of Mechanical Age engineering. Today's binary computers are faster by a factor of billions, but they inherited a fatal architectural flaw from that era: **any instruction can touch any data**. The von Neumann architecture that powers every conventional computer treats code and data as interchangeable bit patterns in a single shared memory. This is the root cause of buffer overflows, code injection, privilege escalation, ransomware, and every other exploit that depends on corrupting what a program can reach.

We have spent seven decades trying to patch this flaw with layers of software defense — firewalls, antivirus, access control lists, sandboxes, encryption at rest. None of them work reliably, because they are all bolted on top of hardware that was never designed to enforce boundaries. Every year brings larger breaches, more sophisticated attacks, and greater damage to the infrastructure that civilization depends on.

### The Church Machine Difference

The Pure Church Lambda Machine does not patch the problem. It eliminates it at the hardware level:

1. **Oil and water** — Data registers (DRn) and context registers (CRn) are physically separate hardware paths. Data can never be confused with a Golden Token capability. There is no bit pattern a program can forge to manufacture access it was not granted. This is not a software check — it is a property of the circuit.

2. **Every operation is capability-checked** — Our 16-line bernoulli.church program traverses 112 security gates. Not because we chose to be cautious, but because the instruction set has no unchecked path. There is no "unsafe" mode, no privilege escalation, no root access. The security is not a feature — it is the architecture.

3. **No central point of corruption** — There is no operating system kernel, no hypervisor, no superuser account. Every resource is an atomic abstraction accessed only through Golden Tokens. Compromising one abstraction gives you nothing — you still need the right token for every other abstraction you want to reach.

4. **Deterministic garbage collection** — The PP250 three-phase Mark-Scan-Sweep process is deterministic, not probabilistic. Memory is reclaimed on schedule, not when convenient. Dangling pointers and use-after-free — the foundation of modern exploit chains — cannot occur.

### Performance Through Security

The counterintuitive insight is that capability security does not cost performance — it enables it:

- **No kernel transitions** — Conventional systems pay enormous overhead switching between user mode and kernel mode thousands of times per second. The Church Machine has no modes to switch between. Every abstraction runs at full speed in its own capability-bounded scope.

- **No bounds checking overhead** — Conventional systems spend cycles checking array bounds, validating pointers, and verifying permissions in software. The Church Machine enforces these at the hardware level, in the same clock cycle as the operation itself.

- **No security scanning** — Conventional systems run antivirus, intrusion detection, and integrity monitoring as background processes consuming CPU, memory, and I/O. The Church Machine needs none of this — violations are impossible, not merely detected.

- **No patch cycles** — Conventional systems require constant software updates to close newly discovered vulnerabilities. The Church Machine's security properties are hardware invariants. They do not degrade over time, and they do not need patches. A Church Machine built today enforces the same security guarantees in a hundred years.

### Future-Safe for the Information Age

The Mechanical Age gave us machines that computed. The Binary Age gave us machines that computed fast. But speed without security is a liability — every networked computer is a potential weapon if it can be subverted.

The Information Age demands machines that compute **correctly and securely by construction**, not by hope and patching. Civilization's critical infrastructure — power grids, financial systems, medical records, democratic processes, military command — runs on computers that any sufficiently motivated attacker can compromise, because the hardware itself has no concept of "you are not allowed to do that."

Ada Lovelace saw that machines could weave algebraical patterns. What she could not foresee was that those patterns would one day control everything, and that the machine's inability to distinguish authorized from unauthorized access would become an existential threat.

The Church Machine is the answer to that threat — not a better patch, but a different foundation. Capability-secured, domain-pure, hardware-enforced. Every operation checked. Every boundary real. Every token unforgeable. Built once, secure forever.

The security of civilization must come first. The architecture must guarantee it.
