# Namespace and Security Model

## Namespace Table Structure

The namespace is the master directory of all resources in the system. Every Golden Token references an entry in the namespace table. Each entry describes a resource with three 32-bit words:

| Word   | Content |
|--------|---------|
| **Word 0** | Base address — 32-bit lump base byte address |
| **Word 1** | Limit + gt_seq (`spare[3] \| gt_seq[7] \| limit_offset[21]`) |
| **Word 2** | CRC + G-bit (`spare[15] \| g_bit[1] \| CRC-16[16]`) |

### Namespace Entry Format

Each namespace entry occupies exactly **3 consecutive 32-bit words** (12 bytes). The slot byte address is calculated as:

```
NS_entry_addr = NS_table_base + object_id × 12
```

The namespace table supports up to **65,536 entries**, bounded by the 16-bit `object_id` field in the Golden Token.

| Bits    | Field          | Description |
|---------|---------------|-------------|
| [20:0]  | `limit_offset` | Object size in words minus 1 |
| [27:21] | `gt_seq`       | Revocation counter — compared against GT `gt_seq` by ChurchNSGate |
| [31:28] | spare          | Reserved |

#### Word 2 Layout (WORD3_LAYOUT)

│    [14:0]      │   │    [15:0]          │
└────────────────┴───┴────────────────────┘
```

| Bits    | Field   | Description |
|---------|--------|-------------|
| [15:0]  | `crc`   | CRC-16/CCITT integrity check result |
| [16]    | `g_bit` | GC mark bit — cleared on every ChurchNSGate access (G=0 = reachable) |
| [31:17] | spare   | Reserved |

**Note on B and F flags**: The B (Bind) flag lives in **bit [31] of GT Word 0** itself (`b_flag` in GT_LAYOUT) — it is a property of the token, not the NS entry. The F (Far/Foreign) concept is represented by the `typ` field in the GT (`typ=10` for Outform). Neither B nor F has a dedicated field in the 3-word NS entry.

## The mLoad Master Validation Path

All namespace access in the Church Machine architecture routes through a single trusted validation path called **mLoad** (implemented as `ChurchMLoad` + `ChurchNSGate` in Amaranth HDL). This is the fundamental security principle: one master validation pipeline that every Church instruction must use to access the namespace.

### Why One Path

Having a single validation path:
- **Minimizes the Trusted Computing Base (TCB)**: Only one piece of code needs to be correct for all namespace access.
- **Eliminates validation gaps**: No instruction can bypass permission checks, bounds checks, CRC validation, or G-bit reset.
- **Maps directly to hardware**: In ASIC/FPGA implementations, mLoad + ChurchNSGate form a single pipeline — there is no way to access namespace memory without passing through them.

### mLoad / ChurchNSGate Validation Sequence

Every namespace access follows this exact sequence. Any failure at any step triggers an immediate FAULT:

```
mLoad(source_capability, required_permission, index, destCR):

  1. Permission Check (mLoad — CHECK_L state)
     Does the source capability have L or M permission?
     (requiredPerm=null skips this check — used for RETURN context restoration)
     Failure → FAULT

  2. Bounds Check (mLoad — CHECK_BOUNDS state)
     Is the index within the source C-List range?
     Index must be < ns_w2.limit_offset
     Failure → FAULT

  3. Fetch Golden Token (mLoad — FETCH_GT state)
     Read the 32-bit GT from the C-List at the given index.

  4. NS Slot Bounds Check (mLoad — CHECK_NS state)
     Is the GT's object_id within the CR15 namespace range?
     Failure → FAULT

  5. Fetch NS Entry (ChurchNSGate — FETCH_LOC / FETCH_W2 / FETCH_W3 states)
     Read NS Entry Word 0 (base), Word 1 (gt_seq + limit_offset), Word 2 (CRC + G-bit).

  6. gt_seq Match (ChurchNSGate — CHECK_VERSION state)
     Does GT gt_seq [22:16] match NS Entry Word 1 gt_seq [27:21]?
     Failure → FAULT VERSION (stale token — entry was revoked or GC'd)

  7. CRC-16/CCITT Integrity (ChurchNSGate — CHECK_VERSION state)
     Recompute CRC-16/CCITT (poly=0x1021, init=0xFFFF) over:
       gt_word0[24:0] + NS Word 0 (base) + NS Word 1 (limit/gt_seq)  [89 bits total]
     Compare against NS Entry Word 2 bits [15:0].
     Failure → FAULT SEAL (tampered NS entry)

  8. G-bit Reset (ChurchNSGate — CHECK_VERSION state)
     Clear G=0 on the accessed namespace entry (NS Entry Word 2 bit [16]).
     This is unconditional — happens on every successful access.
     (GC integration: signals that this entry is reachable)

  9. Write to Destination CR (mLoad — COMPLETE state)
     Write the full capability (GT + NS entry data) to the destination register.
     This is the SOLE path for writing to any CR.

 10. Thread Table Shadow Update (mLoad — UPDATE_THREAD state)
     Write the GT word to the thread table shadow.
     Keeps the thread table continuously current.
```

### The Golden Rule: mLoad Is the Sole Path for All CR Writes

No instruction directly writes to a capability register. All CR writes route through mLoad, which:

1. **Validates** the GT against the namespace (gt_seq, CRC-16, bounds)
2. **Resets G=0** on the accessed namespace entry (GC liveness)
3. **Writes** the validated capability to the destination CR
4. **Updates** the thread table shadow at Thread[CRd]

This means:
- **LOAD**: mLoad validates and writes to CRd
- **CALL**: cLoad runs NSGate + lump header read → writes CR6 (c-list) and CR14 (code)
- **RETURN**: mLoad (direct mode: `sub_direct=1`) revalidates saved E-GT against namespace — catches use-after-free
- **SWITCH**: mLoad validates source GT and writes to privileged register CR12–CR15
- **CHANGE**: Saves data registers + PC to thread lump; CRs reloaded via cLoad on next CALL/RETURN

### Instructions Using mLoad / ChurchNSGate

| Instruction | Validation Path | Destination |
|-------------|----------------|-------------|
| **LOAD** | ChurchMLoad + ChurchNSGate | CRd (user-specified) |
| **CALL** | ChurchMLoad → ChurchNSGate → cLoad | CR6 (c-list), CR14 (code) |
| **RETURN** | ChurchMLoad (direct mode) | CR6, CR14 (re-derived from saved E-GT) |
| **CHANGE** | ChurchMLoad + ChurchNSGate | CR12 (Thread) |
| **SWITCH** | ChurchMLoad + ChurchNSGate | CR12–CR15 (system) |
| **SAVE** | Bounds check only (no NSGate) | Namespace write (GT Word 0) |

## CRC-16/CCITT Integrity Validation

CRC-16/CCITT validation is the mechanism that ensures Golden Tokens and namespace entries have not been corrupted or forged.

### When Validation Occurs

Validation occurs inside ChurchNSGate on every mLoad call — which means every Church instruction that reads from the namespace:

| Operation | Validation |
|-----------|------------|
| **LOAD** | gt_seq match + CRC-16 checked |
| **CALL** | gt_seq match + CRC-16 checked |
| **RETURN** | gt_seq match + CRC-16 checked (on saved E-GT) |

### How Validation Works

When ChurchNSGate processes a namespace entry:

1. The **`gt_seq`** in the Golden Token (bits [22:16]) is compared against the `gt_seq` in NS Entry Word 1 (bits [27:21]). If they do not match, the token is stale and a `VERSION` FAULT is triggered.
2. The **CRC-16/CCITT** is recomputed over 89 bits (`gt_word0[24:0]` + NS Word 0 + NS Word 1) and compared against NS Entry Word 2 bits [15:0]. If they do not match, a `SEAL` FAULT is triggered.

Revocation: increment the `gt_seq` counter in NS Entry Word 1 by 1. All existing GTs for that entry now have a stale `gt_seq` and FAULT on next use. No tracking of outstanding GTs is required — revocation is O(1).

---

## Failsafe Principle

The Church Machine architecture follows a strict failsafe design: **any validation failure triggers a FAULT, handled by a single fault handler**. There are no partial failures, no silent degradation, and no undefined behaviors. The system is either operating correctly or it is faulted.

This applies uniformly to:
- Permission violations (missing required permission bit)
- gt_seq mismatches (stale Golden Token)
- CRC-16 failures (corrupted or tampered NS entry)
- Bounds violations (index out of range)
- Stack overflows (call stack full)
- Stack underflows (return with empty stack)

The fault handler is the single point of error management, ensuring consistent and predictable behavior regardless of the failure mode.

---

## Security Invariants

The Church Machine enforces the following invariants at all times:

### No Direct Privileged Register Access

Only CR0–CR11 are addressable through the 4-bit register encoding in Church instructions. Privileged registers CR12–CR15 are physically unreachable through instruction encoding. This is an architectural constraint, not a software convention.

### Privilege Through SWITCH Only

The SWITCH instruction is the sole mechanism for writing to privileged registers CR12–CR15. It requires appropriate permissions on the source capability.

### Capability-Mediated Access Through mLoad

All resource access goes through capability-mediated C-Lists via the mLoad + ChurchNSGate validation path. LOAD reads from a C-List entry. SAVE writes a GT Word 0 back to memory. There is no instruction that can access namespace entries without a valid Golden Token authorizing the operation. The mLoad path ensures that every access is validated, bounds-checked, CRC-verified, and G-bit-reset.

### Mutually Exclusive Permission Domains

The two mutually exclusive permission domains (Turing and Church) cannot be mixed within a single operation context. This prevents confused deputy attacks where a capability intended for one purpose is misused for another.

| Domain | Permissions | Operations |
|--------|-------------|------------|
| Turing | R, W, X | Read/Write data, Execute code |
| Church | L, S, E | Load/Save Golden Tokens through C-Lists, Enter abstractions |

M (Machine) is a transient microcode elevation (`sub_m_elevated`), never stored in the GT. G is the GC mark bit in NS Entry Word 2, managed by ChurchNSGate.

### G-bit Reset as Security Invariant

The G-bit reset on every namespace access is not optional — it is a security invariant enforced by ChurchNSGate. This ensures that the garbage collector can accurately determine which entries are reachable, preventing:
- **Use-after-free**: Revoked entries have their `gt_seq` incremented, instantly invalidating stale Golden Tokens.
- **Resource leaks**: Unreachable entries are identified and reclaimed.
- **GC evasion**: No instruction can access namespace without triggering G-bit reset.
