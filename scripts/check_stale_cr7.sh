# CI guard: fail if any stale CR7 signal names survive into synthesised Verilog.
#
# The registers were renamed CR7→CR14 in hardware/core.py.  If someone
# regenerates the netlists from an unpatched source the old cr7_wr_* names
# will silently reappear.  This script catches that before it reaches tapeout.
#
# Exit codes:
#   0 — no stale names found (clean)
#   1 — one or more matches found (stale output detected), or a required file is missing

set -euo pipefail

# If file paths are supplied as arguments, check those; otherwise fall back to
# the canonical synthesised-output locations.
