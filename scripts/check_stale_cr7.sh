# CI guard: fail if any stale CR7 signal names survive into synthesised Verilog.
#
# The registers were renamed CR7→CR14 in hardware/core.py.  If someone
# regenerates the netlists from an unpatched source the old cr7_wr_* names
# will silently reappear.  This script catches that before it reaches tapeout.
#
# Exit codes:
#   0 — no stale names found (clean), or only absent synthesised files (warning)
#   1 — one or more matches found in a file that exists (stale output detected)
#
# Absent files are treated as warnings, not failures.  The synthesised
# verilog/church_ti60_f225.v is a build artefact that may not be present in
# a fresh checkout.  Only files that ARE present are checked for stale names.

set -euo pipefail

# If file paths are supplied as arguments, check those; otherwise fall back to
# the canonical synthesised-output locations.
