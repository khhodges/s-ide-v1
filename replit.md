# Church Machine Educational Platform

## Overview

The Church Machine is a capability-secured processor architecture with an educational IDE, targeting the Tang Nano 20K FPGA (Gowin GW2AR-18, 20,736 LUTs). The web-based simulator serves as the IDE — children write, compile, test, and deploy Church Machine programs through a single application. The architecture is capability-based with Golden Token security, extending from family/school use to any organizational scale.

## Project Structure

```
hardware/          — Amaranth HDL for Tang Nano 20K (all features enabled)
simulator/         — Web IDE (HTML/JS/CSS) — the educational product
server/            — Flask backend (SQLite, port 5000)
docs/              — Architecture and reference documentation
church_machine/    — Original pico-ice hardware (reference, not active)
church_sim/        — Original simulator (reference, ported to simulator/)
```

## Architecture

### Abstraction Model (Scale-Free)

Every abstraction follows the canonical CR6/CR7 form:
- CR6 → c-list (capability list)
- CR7 → code at c-list[0] (CLOOMC)
- Entered via CALL (E-GT) or LAMBDA (X-GT)

44 abstractions across 9 layers:
- Layer 0: Boot (NS, Thread, CList, CLOOMC)
- Layer 1: System Services (Salvation, Mint, Memory, Scheduler, Stack)
- Layer 2: Hardware Attachments (UART, LED, Button, Timer, Display)
- Layer 3: Mathematics (SlideRule, Abacus, Constants, Circle)
- Layer 4: Lambda Calculus (Lambda, Church Numerals, PAIR)
- Layer 5: Social (Family, Schoolroom, Friends, Tunnel, Negotiate)
- Layer 6: IDE (Editor, Assembler, Debugger, Deployer)
- Layer 7: Internet (Browser, Messenger, Photos, Social, Video, Email)
- Layer 8: Garbage Collection (PP250 GC)

### Security Model

- Golden Tokens: 32-bit unforgeable capability tokens — Version(7) | Index(17) | Perms(6) | Type(2)
- 6 permission bits: R (read), W (write), X (execute), L (load), S (save), E (enter)
- mLoad 7-step pipeline: type check → version match → seal verify → bounds → perms → F-bit → deliver
- Domain purity: Church (capabilities) and Turing (data) are separate and enforced in hardware
- L/S Church domain controls capability grants — the c-list IS the parental approval
- Version-based revocation: Mint.Revoke increments NS entry version, kills all GT copies instantly
- Negotiate abstraction: dual-approval (parent+teacher) for special grants
- Each sibling has their own isolated namespace

### Hardware Target

- Tang Nano 20K: Gowin GW2AR-18, QN88 package, 27MHz clock
- All features enabled: CHANGE/SWITCH, SEAL_CHECK, FUSED_OPS, GC
- UART: TX pin 17, RX pin 18 (BL616 USB bridge)
- LEDs: pins 15-20 (6 LEDs, active-low)
- Button: pin 88 (stepping)
- Build: `cd hardware && make all` (requires oss-cad-suite)

### Web IDE

- Flask server on port 5000, serves simulator/ as static files
- 8 views: Dashboard, Code, Namespace, Abstractions, Pipeline, Tutorial, REPL, Reference
- State persistence via localStorage
- WebSerial for Tang Nano 20K deployment

### Instruction Set

20 instructions (10 Church + 10 Turing):
- Church: LOAD, SAVE, CALL, RETURN, CHANGE, SWITCH, TPERM, LAMBDA, ELOADCALL, XLOADLAMBDA
- Turing: DREAD, DWRITE, BFEXT, BFINS, MCMP, IADD, ISUB, BRANCH, SHL, SHR + shared RETURN
- 32-bit encoding: opcode[5] | cond[4] | dst[4] | src[4] | imm[15]
- ARM-style condition codes on all instructions (EQ, NE, CS, CC, MI, PL, VS, VC, HI, LS, GE, LT, GT, LE, AL, NV)

## External Dependencies

- Python/Flask: Web server
- SQLite: Local database (server/church_machine.db)
- Amaranth HDL: Hardware synthesis
- localStorage: Client-side state persistence
- oss-cad-suite: FPGA toolchain (yosys, nextpnr-gowin, gowin_pack, openFPGALoader)

## User Preferences

- Church Gold dark theme
- Mobile-responsive for parent mode on handsets
- All feature flags True for Tang build
- No separate dynamicObjects — all entries in namespaceObjects
- B (Bind) bit defaults to 0, auto-cleared by CALL
- C-Lists only have E permission, CLOOMC only X or RX
