# Church Machine Educational Platform

## Overview

The Church Machine is a capability-secured processor architecture with an educational IDE, targeting the Tang Nano 20K FPGA (Gowin GW2AR-18, 20,736 LUTs). The web-based simulator serves as the IDE — children write, compile, test, and deploy Church Machine programs through a single application. The architecture is capability-based with Golden Token security, extending from family/school use to any organizational scale.

## Architecture

### Abstraction Model (Scale-Free)

Every abstraction is a security block with MTBF measured by fault reports over time in a namespace:
- Single NS entry model: one lump, one Inform E-GT, clistCount in word1
- CR7 → code region (Turing X, hardcoded by CALL) — R001 fix
- CR6 → c-list region (Church L, hardcoded by CALL) — R001 fix
- Entered via CALL (E-GT); CALL checks clistCount to split lump
- LAMBDA is a method/instruction within abstractions, not a separate security block

45 abstractions across 9 layers:
- Layer 0: Boot (NS, Thread, CList, CLOOMC)
- Layer 1: System Services (Salvation, Navana, Mint, Memory, Scheduler, Stack, DijkstraFlag)
- Layer 2: Hardware Attachments (UART, LED, Button, Timer, Display) — L/S/E only, NO R/W
- Layer 3: Mathematics (SlideRule [incl. trig/angles], Abacus, Constants, Circle)
- Layer 4: Lambda Calculus (Church Numerals 20-27, PAIR @43) — LAMBDA is NOT a security block
- Layer 5: Social (Family [Hello(GT)] @28, Schoolroom @29, Friends @30, Tunnel @31, Negotiate @32)
- Layer 6: IDE (Editor @33, Assembler @34, Debugger @35, Deployer @36)
- Layer 7: Internet (Browser @37, Messenger @38, Photos @39, Social @40, Video @41, Email @42)
- Layer 8: Garbage Collection (GC @44)

Boot flow: Boot → CALL Salvation → Salvation transitions to Navana → Navana runs forever (no RETURN)
Polymorphic interface: Every abstraction responds to create/destroy/call/inspect
MTBF tracking: Every fault against a security block is counted; MTBF = uptime / fault count

### Security Model

- Golden Tokens: 32-bit unforgeable capability tokens — Version(7) | Index(17) | Perms(6) | Type(2)
- 6 permission bits: R (read), W (write), X (execute), L (load), S (save), E (enter)
- mLoad 7-step pipeline: type check → version match → seal verify → bounds → perms → F-bit → deliver
- Domain purity: Church domain = capabilities (GTs, c-lists); DATA domain = code objects + data; code is NEVER Church domain
- L/S Church domain controls capability grants — the c-list IS the parental approval
- GT types: 00=NULL (zero value), 01=Inform (NS entry, memory), 10=Outform (remote, F-bit auto), 11=Abstract (GT IS value)
- Inform GTs for all abstractions — clistCount in word1 tells CALL how to split the lump
- Mint.Create delegates NS entry to Navana.Add — Navana is sole NS writer
- Perms: any valid RWX combo (Turing) or any valid LSE combo (Church) — FAULT on mixed domains
- Version never reset — Mint.Create increments; Mint.Revoke increments to kill all GT copies instantly
- Negotiate abstraction: dual-approval (parent+teacher) for special grants
- Each sibling has their own isolated namespace — private digital shadow

### NS Entry word1 Layout

```
word1: B(31)|F(30)|G(29)|chain(28)|type(27:26)|clistCount(25:17)|limit(16:0)

clistCount > 0: abstraction lump — CALL splits into CR7 (code, X) + CR6 (c-list, L)
clistCount = 0: plain data object
type = 01 (Inform) for all abstractions
```

### Lump Layout

```
offset 0:       Method table + Code     → CR7 (code, X-only)
codeEnd:        FREESPACE               (unreachable padding)
clistStart:     C-list (GT slots)       → CR6 (c-list, L-only)
allocatedSize:  (power-of-2, min 256)
```

clistStart = allocSize - clistCount. CALL splits the lump using clistCount from word1.

### CLOOMC++ Compiler

Multi-language compiler targeting Church Machine 20-instruction set:
- JavaScript front-end (Phase 1, implemented): JS subset → 32-bit code words
- Haskell front-end (Phase 1b, implemented): Lambda calculus, case expressions, pairs, let bindings → Church Machine instructions
- Symbolic Math front-end (Phase 1c, implemented): Ada Lovelace's 1843 notation — V-variables (V1-V15→DR1-DR15), one operation per line, `let V4 = V2 * V3` or arrow notation `V2 × V3 → V4`, multiply/divide compile to IADD/ISUB loops
- Resident Object Model: c-list = compiler symbol table, maps abstraction names to offsets
- Calling convention: DR0-3 args/return, DR4-11 locals (callee-saved), DR12-15 temporaries (caller-saved)
- Output: upload.json format for Navana.Abstraction.Add
- Auto-detection: compiler identifies language from source syntax (symbolic → haskell → JS)

### Navana as Master Controller

- Sole NS entry writer (except one boot mElevation for Navana's own entry)
- Navana.Add: find free NS slot, write 3-word entry with clistCount
- Navana.Abstraction.Add: process upload.json, allocate lump, write code+c-list, forge E-GT
- Upload validation: R007 fixes (bounds, capability delegation, integer overflow checks)
- Navana.Abstraction.Add: validates codeSize+clistCount<=allocSize, clistCount<=511, power-of-2 allocation

### Upload Format

```json
{
  "abstraction": "Name",
  "type": "abstraction",
  "grants": ["E"],
  "capabilities": [{ "target": 7, "name": "Memory", "grants": ["E"] }],
  "methods": [{ "name": "Method", "code": [0x12345678] }]
}
```

### Hardware Target

- Tang Nano 20K: Gowin GW2AR-18, QN88 package, 27MHz clock
- All features enabled: CHANGE/SWITCH, SEAL_CHECK, FUSED_OPS, GC
- UART: TX pin 17, RX pin 18 (BL616 USB bridge)
- LEDs: pins 15-20 (6 LEDs, active-low)
- Button: pin 88 (stepping)
- Build: `cd hardware && make all` (requires oss-cad-suite)

### Web IDE

- Flask server on port 5000, serves simulator/ as static files
- 9 views: Math (default, was REPL), Code, Tutorial, Dashboard, Namespace, Abstractions, Pipeline, Reference, Docs
- Tutorial tab: two tutorials selectable via buttons:
  - Discovery Path (Bernoulli): interactive step-through with REPL execution (tutorial.js)
  - SlideRule Comparative Study: 23-step walkthrough of architecture, compiler, JS vs Haskell comparison, disassembly, performance, security, and hands-on guide (sliderule_tutorial.js)
- CLOOMC++ compiler integrated: write source → compile → create abstraction (JS, Haskell, Symbolic Math)
- REPL: interactive calculator + "Compile Session" button compiles let-bindings to Church Machine code
- Math Challenge: sidebar panel with grade-appropriate problems (K-2 add/sub, 3-5 mul/div, 6-8 squares/mixed, 9-10 algebra, 11-12/IB factorial/exponents), answer checking, hints, and dual-domain explanations: Turing domain (body — IADD/ISUB/BRANCH, numbers and physical addresses, DR0/DR1 args) shown in blue, Church domain (mind — CALL SET(a,b) ADD, one instruction, symbols only) shown in gold. TPERM only used for capabilities from untrusted sources. Hardware checks permissions automatically on LOAD and CALL.
- Math guide popup: one-time "Body and Mind" popup when Math tab first opens (after welcome popup dismissed), explaining left=mind (Church/symbols), right=body (Turing/numbers), Ada's 1843 program, Turing as Church's student. Dismissed via "Got it", stored in localStorage key churchMachine_mathGuideDismissed.
- 50-50 split: Math tab panels default to equal width, separated by draggable divider bar (gold on hover)
- Docs tab: browse docs/*.md and docs/figures/*.html from the IDE; markdown rendered in-app, figures embedded via iframe
- Welcome popup: first-visit parent guide explaining Church Machine, Family abstraction (NS[28]), Golden Tokens, and setup steps; "Set Up My Family" opens settings, "Skip for Now" dismisses; suppresses language intros until dismissed
- Settings: gear icon in intro popup opens settings modal with student name, school, K-12 + IB grade dropdown, family members (role + name, up to 8)
- Grade-adapted intros: intro popup content dynamically adapts to student grade level (early/elementary/middle/high/advanced/IB tiers)
- Progress tracking: compilations, abstractions created, drafts, REPL sessions, languages used, recent activity history
- State persistence via localStorage (editor state, settings, progress, intro dismissals, welcome dismissal, family members)
- WebSerial for Tang Nano 20K deployment
