# Church-Turing Meta-Machine (CTMM) Simulator

## Overview
This project develops a comprehensive simulator for the Church-Turing Meta-Machine (CTMM) capability-based architecture, incorporating Kenneth James Hamer-Hodges' failsafe security design with "Golden Tokens." The simulator integrates concepts from Church's lambda calculus and Turing's computational model to create a secure execution environment. Its primary purpose is to provide an interactive web interface for understanding capability-based security, secure system design, and foundational computational principles. The project aims to advance secure computational models and offer robust tools for both learning and practical application in secure system development.

## User Preferences
- Tooltips positioned below for elements near top of viewport
- Minimal UI with consolidated header controls
- Auto-switching to Dashboard when Reset/Step/Run clicked
- Code persistence in localStorage for session continuity
- Assembly Editor defaults to Access.asm when empty
- Example buttons append code instead of replacing
- Ctrl+Z undoes last code change
- Punt TPERM standardization until Sim-32 mature and ARM market direction clear

## System Architecture

The CTMM simulator offers both a Haskell console interface and a web-based visualization. The web interface utilizes a Python HTTP server, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for simulation logic and UI.

### Core Architectural Concepts

-   **Capability-based Security**: Access control via "Golden Tokens" (GTs).
-   **Register Architecture**:
    -   **Context Registers (CR0-CR7)**: Hold Golden Tokens (instruction-addressable). CR15 for Namespace root, CR8 for Thread identity, CR7 for Nucleus, CR6 for current C-List.
    -   **Data Registers (DR0-DR15)**: Hold 64-bit numeric values (Sim-64) or x0-x31 32-bit (Sim-32).
-   **Golden Token Permissions**: 6 bits — R (Read), W (Write), X (Execute), L (Load), S (Save), E (Enter). M is transient (elevated by microcode). G is per-namespace-entry metadata.
-   **Permission Domains**: Turing (R, W, X), Church (L, S), Lambda (E).
-   **Namespace Entry**: A 3-word descriptor (Location, Limit, Seals) with per-entry gBit for GC.
-   **MAC Validation**: Hardware-enforced security check during `LOAD`. FNV hash MAC computation.
-   **mLoad Master Validation**: Single trusted path for all namespace access – every Church instruction routes through mLoad, which enforces permission check, bounds check, MAC validation, G-bit reset, and thread table shadow update.
-   **Boot Sequence**: A 4-step secure initialization process.
-   **Failsafe Security**: All validation failures route to a single FAULT handler.
-   **Deterministic Garbage Collection (PP250)**: Three-phase Mark-Scan-Sweep. Mark sets G=1 on all namespace entries. Scan walks DNA tree via mLoad (resets G=0 on reachable entries). Sweep identifies entries still G=1 as garbage, bumps version.
-   **GT-Literals**: Direct GT-Literal (30-bit value, Type=10) and Indirect GT-Literal (namespace-backed handle). New Church instructions: LDL (Load Literal), STL (Store Literal), LAMBDA (application).
-   **Network Transparency**: GT-Literals can act as capability-secured handles for remote resources, supporting RPC, transparent login, and secure data handling via standard HTTPS for fetch/flush operations.
-   **Thread Table C-List Snippet**: Thread shadow tracks only CR0-CR7 (instruction-addressable registers).
-   **CHANGE/RETURN Semantics**: `CHANGE` uses `CALL` microcode to push a call stack frame. `CALL` and `CHANGE` store the instruction address. `RETURN` adds step size and checks E permission on saved CR6 GT before revalidation.

### Web Interface (UI/UX)

The web interface provides seven views: Dashboard, Namespace Browser, Assembly Editor, Capabilities Explorer, Instructions, Tutorial, and Code Browser. The styling is a dark-themed, IDE-like design.

### Key Features

-   **Built-in Abstractions**: Includes `Boot`, `Threads`, `SlideRule`, `Abacus`, `Circle`, `CapabilityManager`, `DateTime`, and `Lambda`.
-   **Instruction Set**: Custom CTMM instruction set with Church-specific and Turing-specific instructions. All instructions use a 32-bit format. Only CR0-CR7 are instruction-addressable.
-   **Condition Codes**: ARM-style condition flags for conditional execution.
-   **State Persistence**: Automatic saving and restoring using browser local storage.

### Hardware Implementations

The project includes synthesizable hardware implementations in SystemVerilog (`verilog/`) and Amaranth HDL (`ctmm_amaranth/`) for the CTMM architecture.

### Simulator Comparison: Sim-64 (CTMM) vs Sim-32 (RV32-Cap)

-   **Sim-64 (CTMM)**: Custom ISA, 64-bit GTs, custom processor, hardware implementations.
-   **Sim-32 (RV32-Cap)**: RISC-V RV32I base ISA, 32-bit GTs, software simulation only. Uses custom RISC-V opcodes for capability instructions. Includes a Flask web server for its interface.

### Boot Image Builder

A tool (`riscv_cap/boot_builder.py`) constructs namespace tables, thread objects, C-Lists, and GTs, exporting them as JSON or binary memory images, matching the simulator's MAC computation.
