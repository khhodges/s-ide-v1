The program multiplied, divided, added and subtracted step by step, looping to accumulate the answer. If the final variable held \u22121/30, the program worked. If not, there was a bug.<br><br>Ada's original actually did have a small error \u2014 making the first computer program also the first program with a bug.

He showed that every computable function can be expressed using just three things: variables, abstraction (λx.body), and application (f x). No numbers, no data types, no hardware — just functions applied to functions.<br><br>" +
            "<strong>The 1936 paper:</strong> Church's 'An Unsolvable Problem of Elementary Number Theory' introduced the lambda calculus and proved that the Entscheidungsproblem (decision problem) posed by David Hilbert had no solution — there is no general algorithm that can decide whether an arbitrary mathematical statement is true or false. This was one of the most profound results in the history of mathematics, published independently of Turing's equivalent result using Turing machines.<br><br>" +
            "<strong>Church-Rosser theorem:</strong> Church and his student J. Barkley Rosser proved that the order in which you reduce (simplify) a lambda expression doesn't matter — if an answer exists, you'll reach the same one regardless of the path you take. This confluence property is what makes lambda calculus reliable as a foundation for computation. It means the Church Machine gives the same answer no matter how the hardware schedules its reductions.<br><br>" +
            "<strong>Alpha and Beta reduction:</strong> Lambda calculus has only two fundamental operations. Alpha reduction (α) renames variables to avoid confusion: λx.x becomes λy.y. Beta reduction (β) applies a function to an argument: (λx.x+1) 3 becomes 3+1. Every computation — sorting, searching, encrypting, rendering — is ultimately a sequence of beta reductions.<br><br>" +
            "<strong>Connection to Lisp:</strong> In 1958, John McCarthy created Lisp, the first programming language based directly on Church's lambda calculus. McCarthy's insight was that lambda expressions could be implemented on real hardware. The <code>(lambda (x) (+ x 1))</code> of Lisp is Church's <code>λx.x+1</code> in parenthesized form. Every functional programming language since — ML, Haskell, Erlang, Clojure, Scala — descends from Church through McCarthy.<br><br>" +

Addition, multiplication, and even predecessor can all be defined as lambda expressions. The examples in this editor let you compile Church numerals to real machine code — completing the circle from abstract mathematics back to hardware.<br><br>" +
