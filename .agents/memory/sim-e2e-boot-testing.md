description: How to reliably establish cold-boot simulator state in Playwright E2E tests for the Church Machine IDE.

## The pattern that works

```javascript
// 1. Pre-suppress modals before page load
await page.addInitScript(() => {
    localStorage.setItem('church_whatsnew_dismissed_perm', '1');
});

// 2. Intercept the boot binary
await page.route('**/api/boot-image/binary', route =>
    route.fulfill({ status: 404, contentType: 'text/plain', body: 'no binary' })
);

await page.goto('/simulator/');
await page.waitForLoadState('networkidle');

// 3. Clear boot state THEN reset — order matters
await page.evaluate(() => {
    window.bootImage = null;
    window.bootImageAvailable = false;
    window.bootConfig = null;
    if (typeof sim !== 'undefined') sim.reset(); // → nsCount = 7
});
await page.waitForTimeout(300);

// Suite 2 only: force bootComplete before compileAndCreateAbstraction()
await page.evaluate(() => { sim.bootComplete = true; });
```

## Why instantBoot() doesn't work in tests

`instantBoot()` runs `sim._bootStep()` synchronously in a while-loop (30 iterations).
Boot phase **B:04 CALL_HOME** starts an async network fetch inside `_bootStep()`.
The fetch's `.then()` callback (which increments `bootStep` from 4 → 5) is a
Promise microtask — it cannot run while the synchronous while-loop is executing.
Result: `instantBoot()` runs 30 iterations all stuck at `bootStep = 4` and returns
`false` with `bootComplete` still false.

## Why slowBoot() doesn't work after sim.reset() in a test

`slowBoot()` has the guard: `if (bootAnimating || sim.bootComplete || sim.halted) return;`

The page's own auto-boot (fired during page load) sets `bootAnimating = true`.
`sim.reset()` does NOT clear `bootAnimating` (it's an app-run.js module variable,
not a `sim` property). So a subsequent `slowBoot()` call exits immediately.

## Why resetSim() crashes Chromium in tests

`resetSim()` calls `switchView('dashboard')` and other DOM mutation functions
synchronously from inside `page.evaluate()`. This causes a Chromium process crash
("ESRCH: No such process") in the Replit sandbox environment.

## Why forcing sim.bootComplete = true is correct for NS-slot tests

`compileAndCreateAbstraction()` has exactly one guard: `if (!sim.bootComplete)`.
It does NOT use CR14, memory layout, or any other hardware boot output.
Navana.Abstraction.Add (the slot allocator) calls `sim.writeNSEntry()` which is
pure JS. Forcing `bootComplete = true` is the minimal, correct intervention.

**Why:** `bootComplete` is a JS flag, not hardware state. The NS slot allocation
pathway is entirely JS-side and doesn't depend on the hardware boot phases.

## What's New modal

The `#whatsNewModal` blocks clicks on the hamburger menu and other UI elements.
It is suppressed by `localStorage.setItem('church_whatsnew_dismissed_perm', '1')`.
Use `page.addInitScript()` (not `page.evaluate()` after goto) so it runs before
the page's JS reads localStorage on startup.

## nsCount after cold boot

After `sim.reset()` with `window.bootImage = null`, `_initNamespaceTable()` calls
`_getHardwareBootCatalog()` which returns 7 entries (slots 0–6). `sim.nsCount = 7`.
Slot 7 is null/programmable and produces no NS table row.
