name: EFX_MAP $readmemb path resolution
description: Where Efinity EFX_MAP looks for $readmemb binary files, confirmed working approach for Sapphire SoC BRAM and CM DMEM BRAM.

## Confirmed working approach: $readmemb with files in work_syn/

Both the CM DMEM and the Sapphire SoC ROM use the SAME mechanism:

1. Patch the Verilog source to use `$readmemb("bare_filename.bin", array_var);`
2. Write the `.bin` files into `work_syn/` — EFX_MAP resolves bare filenames
   relative to `--work_dir` (work_syn/), NOT the project root.
3. Run `efx_run.py --flow map --work_dir work_syn` — EFX_MAP reads the .bin
   files during elaboration and propagates INIT values into the VDB/bitstream.

**Sapphire SoC ROM** (ram_symbol0..3, 8192×8-bit per lane):
- `scripts/patch_sapphire_init.py` patches sapphire.v with $readmemb calls
- `scripts/gen_sapphire_symbol_bins.py firmware.bin --out-dir work_syn/`
  writes the four lane .bin files to work_syn/
- run_efx_map.sh does: `mkdir -p work_syn` → firmware make → gen_sapphire_symbol_bins →
  patch_sapphire_init → efx_run

**CM DMEM** (dmem_b0..3, depth depends on NUC_PROGRAM):
- `patch_cm_bram.py` converts the 32-bit dmem array to four byte-lane $readmemb
  declarations AND writes `cm_dmem_b0..3.bin` directly into work_syn/

## What does NOT work (all confirmed failing)

| Approach | Result |
|---|---|
| `initial begin` inline assignments on inferred arrays | ❌ EFX_MAP silently ignores for inferred BRAMs |
| `$readmemb` with files in soc_combined/ (project root) | ❌ Not found — EFX_MAP CWD is work_syn/ |
| patching map.v (outflow/*.map.v) after synthesis | ❌ PNR reads BRAM init from VDB not map.v |

**Why**: EFX_MAP's internal CWD when called via `efx_run.py --work_dir work_syn` is
`work_syn/`, not the project root. Bare filenames in `$readmemb` resolve relative to
that internal CWD.

## Note on patch_cm_bram.py's misleading comment

Lines 113-116 say "relative to project root … Write bin files to project root" but
`bin_dir = project_dir` is NEVER USED. The actual write goes to `work_syn_dir` (via
`write_bin_files(vals, depth, work_syn_dir)`). The comment is wrong; files go to work_syn/.

## Other confirmed facts

- UART port: ttyUSB2 = Sapphire SoC UART (baud 57600, CLOCKDIV=53)
- Bridge: `python3 hardware/soc_combined/callhome_bridge.py --port=/dev/ttyUSB2 --insecure`
- Device UID: c0ffee0100000001, board_type=3 (Ti60-Full)
- UART CLOCKDIV=53 must be written before first uart_puts
- Project XML (church_soc_cm.xml) uses relative paths — run scripts from hardware/soc_combined/
- openFPGALoader flash ID `097f0000` failure: use Efinity Programmer GUI "JTAG to SPI Active Flash" mode
- Chromebook synthesis: 4+ GB RAM required; use DigitalOcean 8 GB droplet ($0.08/hr)
